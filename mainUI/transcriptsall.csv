111,301,awesome,
112,301,what's your dream job, my dream job would be to just work for myself and making lots of money um i don't know i don't really have a dream job just something that i can i can work under my own terms and get paid decently and and be in a creative creative environment
113,301,mhm,
114,301,how hard is that, um i don't know i think it's just a matter of finding the right situation so right now eh it's been people are a little conservative about what they want so and how they want it so it's a little tougher than it seems <se> it should be but i don't know i think when the situation's right i don't think it's too difficult
115,301,yeah,
116,301,it can be tough to find a good job these days, yep
117,301,what do you do now, i work as an assistant <as> administrative assistant through a temp agency so it's just basically i get sent out to do uh
118,301,cool, to do desk jobs 
119,301,are you happy you did that, um yes and no i mean i feel like i feel like i could do more but you know it works so  you know yeah
120,301,okay,
121,301,how close are you to your family, i'm pretty close i mean they're around so
122,301,hmm,
123,301,what are some things that make you really mad, um god really mad stupid people just basically doing just doing anything to annoy me um that's basically <ba> that's the big thing just just irritating stupid people <laughter> who just do things just to provoke provoke me for no reason at all
124,301,mhm,
125,301,can you give me an example of that, um what's a good example just random people who who think it's funny to just sit there and get a rise out of me just it doesn't have to be one any specific situation it's just people who just think it's funny to i think they're just generally sadistic and they just think it's it's funny to to just prod you like it's like poking a stick at an angry dog knowing that they know how to they just wanna push your buttons for no reason so
126,301,right,
127,301,when was the last time that happened, uh god i don't remember i with those situations i usually try not to remember <laughter> when when it happens i just i just let it go and just like the past is the past i just tend not to look back
128,301,i understand,
129,301,do you consider yourself an introvert, what do you mean
130,301,let's come back to that later, okay
131,301,what do you do to relax, god what do i do to relax i like to run i like to go to the gym listen to music i have a lot of musician friends so i just so i'm usually around musicians so anything of that sort i like i like everything from punk rock art to tattoos to just anything that's that's generally art and creative
132,301,awesome,
133,301,who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life, who's been a positive <pos> i think it's just friends in general who who seem to who seem to do well and i think they they're very inspiring and which is sometimes a a bit tough in in a town like los angeles where i think everybody's on the go trying to accomplish their own goals so they don't
134,301,mhm, it's sometimes hard to find someone who's gonna be uplifting or try to be inspiring so i don't really have anybody in particular but people have kind of brought up things here and there
135,301,like what, you know just like hey instead of instead of doing this how about doing that or hey you're good at this why aren't you doing that or something like that just you know i'm always looking for new opportunities so they always point out things that maybe i might i could do differently instead of just being negative saying hey don't do that that's no that's why are you doing that it's a waste of time
136,301,mmm,
137,301,that's good,
138,301,how are you at controlling your temper, um i guess it depends on who you talk to
139,301,<laughter>, i'm i'm okay at it i could probably work at that um i don't know i mean i can i i think i can do better at it
140,301,can you give me an example of that, well back to the point about people provoking me so i mean i try not to blow steam and let them get under my skin so i just usually try not to let it get to me but i don't know i guess with temper i guess it depends on how i handle my stress lately i've been better at it just because i think my situation's been a little bit better
141,301,that's good,
142,301,have you been diagnosed with depression, no
143,301,have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d, no
144,301,have you ever served in the military, no
145,301,okay,
146,301,is there anything you regret, um nothing major i mean maybe when i was younger i could've traveled more or i could've worked towards something that paid better job-wise but i mean those are all things that i think at any point in life you always think like well i coulda shoulda would've done but you know but then again i think that's natural for anybody i mean i could i could've become a banker or i could've become a lawyer or a doctor and made about ten times the money that i make now but but then again i don't like the law and i don't like medicine so so i'm it wasn't meant to be so
147,301,right,
148,301,there are always trade offs in life aren't there, yeah
149,301,what made you decide to do that, so um i think i think my in my life i knew that i there's a lot of things i have <ha> there's more dislikes <laughter> than likes so i kinda narrowed it down to what am i good at and what am i not good at and what am i gonna work well or who who am i gonna work well with and who will i not work well with so i kind of i kinda sorted out and then the list kind of mmm kind of answered itself so
150,301,that sounds really hard, no it i don't think it was hard but it was just but i think it was a real reality check and i think it it's kind of a good thing 'cause sometimes trying to conform to doing things that doesn't really fit you doesn't make sense it's like trying to shove a a round peg into a square a square hole and it's like it just no matter how you try to shove it in it's not gonna go in so sometimes it's just might as well go down a path that seems to work better for you
151,301,right,
152,301,that makes sense,
153,301,what's one of your most memorable experiences, memorable experiences um hmm i think it's just i don't really have like any one in particular i think i think every day is almost like a memorable experience whether it's positive or negative i think it's just everything from getting it just just the fact that i got a job and i can i can take care of myself is already almost like a memorable experience maybe for the average person it it sounds stupid but you know i think just the fact that i'm able i'm able to get this far in life without like completely self-destructing is already an accomplishment so i feel like i've gotten somewhere
154,301,that's great, maybe not to not maybe not to the point to the average person they might think like well why aren't you a millionaire but you know what not everybody can be a millionaire
155,301,yeah,
156,301,i see what you mean, yeah
157,301,when was the last time you felt really happy, um when was the last time i really felt happy um i don't know i'm not really someone who's like i don't have any real high highs or low lows i mean i haven't hit any lows so i mean i i don't know i'm usually pretty i feel like i'm a level person and i'm pretty happy <ha> every day i feel like if i accomplish one thing then i'm pretty happy so i guess to answer the question probably mmm probably yesterday i just feel like if i if i'm able to accomplish something then then hey i'm happy
158,301,that's great,
159,301,how would your best friend describe you, i don't know i don't really have a best friend but i mean i well to answer the question generally friends i think they would say that i'm very <ver> pretty outgoing i'm pretty determined i'm trying you know i try to you know i try to interact as much as possible i'm always out networking as much as possible so i don't know i guess that's basically what i think they would describe me as
160,301,okay,
161,301,okay i think i've asked everything i need to, okay

252,302,goodbye ,
253,303,hi i'm ellie thanks for coming in today i was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment think of me as a friend i don't judge i can't i'm a computer i'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you i'll ask a few questions to get us started and please feel free to tell me anything your answers are totally confidential ,
254,303,how are you doing today, okay how 'bout yourself
255,303,i'm great thanks,
256,303,where are you from originally, here in california
257,303,really, yeah
258,303,what are some things you really like about l_a , oh well that it's big and broad there's a lot to do a lot of um um job opportunities than other states um pretty much that it's big and there's a lot you can do here
259,303,yeah,
260,303,what are some things you don't really like about l_a, traffic um maybe the violence rate bad news even though you know you wanna know what's going on in your environment but you still have to watch it so you can you know look out to see what's going on on a daily basis
261,303,mhm,
262,303,what'd you study at school, sociology i have a um two year degree in liberal arts but my major was sociology

265,303,what's your dream job, well since metro is steady growing um my dream job is to move up in the company and i'm about to actually start some classes for supervisory next week so um 'cause they look to promote within the company so that's the good thing there's a lot of opportunities at metro where you can take classes and they'll pay for your tuition and things of that nature
266,303,mhm,
267,303,that sounds like a great situation , thanks
268,303,how hard is that, well it's not actually hard as right now it's easy if you take advantage of it right now 'cause they look to promote within so you know so since i'm already working there that's a good thing so it's good to go ahead and take the classes that you need that you're interested in and go ahead and move up the ladder as soon as possible 
269,303,that makes sense ,

275,303,right,
276,303,how hard is that, well i look at it like it it goes with i mean it comes with experience you know um you do something on a continuous basis usually you some somewhere down the line you become good at it you know so i i look at it like that so i've been driving for years and dealing with the public so it's just how you handle circumstances you you know treat people like you wanna be treated
277,303,has that gotten you in trouble, no i'm pretty good at it now maybe when i was younger you know you as you get older you get wiser you learn different things and i'm still learning today
278,303,that's good,
279,303,yeah,
280,303,who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life, i would say my family you know my kids you know even though you know i had been having a lot of deaths around me but that's just go that's part of the life experience you know you born here but you gotta leave here one day but my kids will keep me you know sane and you know i love them and my family  
281,303,that sounds like a great situation, thank you
282,303,do you find it easy to be a parent, no <laughter>
283,303,what's the hardest thing about being a parent, um setting good examples you know because you're the first teacher you know and you wanna set a positive good example for your kids and i think that's a good thing and it starts at home
284,303,mhm,
285,303,can you give me an example of that, well um by you being the first teacher your kids you're you're their one that they see on a daily basis when they wake up so whatever's been taught in the home they lookin' and learning every day you know whether it's a home school you know people kids have a tendency to do things what they see you know what i mean  so you try to keep it positive teach 'em good morals and values and how to get along with other people regardless of race and you know different things of that nature
286,303,mhm ,
287,303,tell me about your kids, i have a um four and a half year old son i have a seven year old daughter and i also have a twenty three year old
288,303,aw, yeah i'm 'bout to be well my daughter's pregnant with a boy she has three um little girls so i have three grandkids and um one on the way which is a boy this time
289,303,wow,
290,303,awesome , yeah thank you
291,303,what's the hardest thing about being a parent, the hardest thing is well right now i'm a single parent so that makes it hard alone itself you know and
292,303,yeah, they can be expensive at times you know it depends on the person's situation you know the whether they have help or a job you know things of that nature to help the situation better but it's hard you know but you i try to you know keep a job keep food in the house you know just maintain and support my kids the best way i can
293,303,yeah i see what you mean,
294,303,what's one of your most memorable experiences , with my kids or just period
295,303,whatever comes to your mind, what's memorable for me is that i'm the only one in my family with a degree so it's kinda like yeah it's kinda even though i'm the baby of ten kids you know
296,303,wow, and i've always kept that in the back of my mind even though everybody well pretty much my whole family have decent job but i'm the only one with a degree so i kinda like gave myself a pat on the back like you know you know i just that's the only thing i remember graduating you know and my family there and to support me 
297,303,that's so good to hear, thank you
298,303,how did you feel in that moment , happy that i accomplished something you know just even though it may not be much but it was better than just have having a high school diploma and i had um i was working on my bachelor's degree but i ended up in a bad car accident i never went back i got distracted and you know i was working at the same time but i was just like moreso i needed income than than um schooling at that time because i was a young parent you know 'cause i had my daughter at seventeen so i was like i needed the money to support her but i never went back but i feel like it's never too late so i feel like i'll take some classes now that i'm with metro to help me move up the ladder so  that's why i'm starting a class next week
299,303,yeah,
300,303,that sounds like a great situation , thank you
301,303,what advice would you give yourself ten or twenty years ago, hm well the advice i would've gave myself that i probably wouldn't have been a young mother at a young age and that i probably would've stayed in school you know not let the accident just distract me and not i would've remained in school i probably wouldn't have had kids early you know um rather i probably would've stayed in school and probably have a part time job or something just i just feel like um education is a excellent thing for a person just having knowledge and learning different things keeping your mind open to learning new ideas every day so i think that's a plus you know in anybody's shoes just to better they selves you know through education maybe to um maybe promote within your company or whatever the case may be that they help better your career
302,303,right,
303,303,yeah,
304,303,could you have done anything to avoid it, i'm not quite sure um you learn from your mistakes you know but at the same time you don't continue to make the same ones i feel like it's okay to make a mistake but long as you do something to change you know um like myself even though i'm going to school late but still i'm going you know i wanna better myself career wise so 
305,303,yeah there are always tradeoffs in life aren't there , yes
306,303,when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about, my oldest daughter we had a argument because just the life that she's living right now and the things that she's going through and um i had told her that she just needed to make some changes to better her situation and uh we got into an argument because you know how your kids sometimes don't wanna hear it you know hear the stuff that you're saying even though it's true or  or they just you know well they just don't wanna hear it you know they may be going through something they don't wanna hear but we got into a argument about it but
307,303,right, that just happened you know i just told her i'm not
308,303,how close are you to them, i'm sorry
309,303,how close are you to them, very close very close it's just that the the situation my daughter's in she just needs to make some changes to better her her life and I'll be telling
310,303,tell me more about that, she's um she's kinda like stubborn in her own way you know i was raised to listen to your mom you know your mom's not gonna tell you nothing wrong and i've been telling her over the years you know different things and it's it's kinda like i was talking to a wall because she she did the opposite
311,303,mhm, and now she's she regretting it you know 'cause she's like my mom told me this you know mom i'm doing the opposite so i guess she gotta bump her head a couple of times to get it it's kinda like i done told you i done left it alone and now it's up to you to make the change
312,303,yeah,
313,303,how hard is that, it's very frustrating because it's like i'm talking to a wall and she's not hearing me and i'm like it seem like it's taking forever for her to change but it's left up to the individual whenever they're ready you know what i mean once the person get tired of something they'll make it change it may not be when you want it to happen but
314,303,yeah,
315,303,yeah, the ball is her court you know i only can do so much
316,303,i'm sorry,
317,303,i see what you mean,
318,303,how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep, oh wow i have my days um since i have two little ones um i kinda like trained them to go to bed at eight o clock because you know they gotta go to school and i think it's important to have a good night's rest because it kinda like <clears throat> it it kinda like gets you ready for the next day or you know how you gonna feel if you rested what type of person you'll be that day you know 'cause everybody have they days whether they're good or bad but that's just a part of life and i feel like if you had a good night's good good night's rest hopefully you'll have a good day you know
319,303,mhm,
320,303,do you feel that way often, pretty much you know i need my rest because i'm out there driving that bus and dealing with all these people and you know  the job itself if very stressful so i feel like if i'm rested it'll help me
321,303,right,
322,303,what are you like when you don't sleep well, what am i like irritated tired um lazy you know feel like i wanna lay down probably go to sleep <laughter> get the rest that i need but <laughter>

366,304,do you have roommates, yes i do 
367,304,tell me more about that, um they're they're friendly it's just that they're very quiet 'cause i'm not used to that environment
368,304,oh,
369,304,what's it like for you living with them, it's fine like the how much it costs is very cheap so that's good and they're friendly so it's fine I just wish it was a little bit it could've been better so yeah 
370,304,could you have done anything to avoid it , yes <laughter> 
371,304,could you say a little more about that , um i had a different option to live with somebody else and i'm still friends with the female and comes to find out that we connect more than the roommates that I live with so I kinda regret moving in with the roommates I have now versus who i was supposed to move with in the beginning so but i'm stuck for a year so it's whatever 
372,304,mm,
373,304,i'm sorry to hear that, that's fine
374,304,how do you know them, how do i know who i
375,304,let's come back to that later, yeah <laughter>
376,304,what are some things that make you really mad , there's nothing that really gets me really mad that i can think of the top of my head um
377,304,whatever comes to your mind, um maybe when it comes to schools how they treat the children especially children of color maybe 
378,304,mhm, that really gets me mad
379,304,okay,
380,304,do you consider yourself an introvert, mm yes

386,304,<laughter>,
387,304,how did you feel in that moment, uh i felt very betrayed and belittled because she's my little sister and she shouldn't be disrespecting me in any type of way because i'm an adult so yeah i was not feeling the situation at all
388,304,mhm,
389,304,can you tell me about that, um just her getting into grown folks' business and it was a conversation between me and my mother and i guess she overheard what was being said and she felt like through my actions that i was choosing somebody else over my family when that wasn't even the case but because she didn't know the whole situation she just automatically assumed and put stuff on facebook about me disrespecting me calling me out by name and it was just yeah so <laughter> 
390,304,oh my gosh, and she then comes to me about it like she did all this other stuff on facebook i don't that's one thing i don't like either is when you i hate indirect comments like if you have if you need to talk to me come directly to me don't put it on facebook tell other people that's a pet peeve of mine so i really don't like that
391,304,yeah that sucks, yeah so but i mean we're fine now so that's good
392,304,that's so good to hear, yeah
393,304,what advice would you give yourself ten or twenty years ago, to not  believe people so easily so gullible to not be so gullible
394,304,hm,
395,304,okay,
396,304,tell me more about that, i guess i've been hearing that lately how i believe anybody anything that somebody says without really thinking about it or without having them prove it so i guess you could say i let i made a lot of mistakes i don't wanna say i regretted it because i'm glad i went through it while i was younger than me getting older and going through the same situations so um yeah i believe people too easily and i give people too much chances  so
397,304,hm, yeah

460,305,yeah, and uh so but i think today uh i applied at ralphs so hopefully i'll get that job i should have that job actually so um but i'm starting to see a light like i said at the end of the tunnel now a little by little

467,305,mhm, outdoors type of guy so
468,305,yeah,
469,305,i'd love to hear about one of your trips, uh one of my trips would be uh i spent a year and a half in japan and uh on the uh lower island uh there that uh they built that bridge 
470,305,wow, uh the largest bridge in the world uh and uh i went there to work for  uh for an all white oh uh an all white tiger act and uh working for a japanese circus  so it was interesting that a lot of people on that island hadn't really seen a lot of americans  'cause that was also one of the islands that we uh that they bombed 
471,305,mhm, so there was a lot of negativity but i i pretty have a good idea out you know outlook uh on life uh especially during those times you know i i enjoyed myself you know through all the traveling and and meeting new people and um eating you know different um diverse foods and uh it was a good experience for me  all of that whole experience was pretty good for me you know just traveling around with circuses and uh  you know it's been great
472,305,nice,
473,305,what are some things you really like about l_a, uh probably um one some of the things i like about l_a there's not a lot that i like about l_a but um i like hollywood i like the the the movie industry um
474,305,uh huh, the uh huge uh um different different people you know different uh different ethnics of uh people here you know uh i enjoy talking to uh few you know a lot of foreigners you know i like to see where they came from and and what what it's like there 
475,305,mhm,
476,305,yeah, traffic's atrocious you know
477,305,yeah,
478,305,what are some things that make you really mad, traffic <laughter> uh ignorance uh being disrespected uh being disrespectful or whatever you know other people being disrespectful toward you or other people um that's about it
479,305,okay, dishonesty
480,305,when was the last time that happened, pardon me
481,305,when was the last time that happened , uh it happens on a daily basis it seems like you know i ride the bus a lot so uh you know or i if i'm riding my bike uh people tend to almost run me over so if i'm not totally paying attention to traffic uh you know i find myself sometimes
482,305,mm, you know having to wait to see what they're gonna do instead of i having the right of way or uh something like that
483,305,yeah,
484,305,that sucks, yeah big time
485,305,what do you do when you're annoyed, what do i do when i'm annoyed
486,305,mhm, um probably sit there and uh sit there and vent you know uh speak my mind even though a lot of times it's i'm myself you know just like you know assholes or whatever you um well you know i carry rocks in my back pocket so i can it you know it happens so much where i i just it just amazes me at what people will do sometimes you know you almost get run over all you know i i probably almost get run over probably on a daily basis   and if i wasn't paying attention i'd be up shit creek
487,305,wow,
488,305,yeah,
489,305,how hard is that, uh it's hard with dealing with people especially trying not to react 'cause there's consequences for your reactions
490,305,yeah,
491,305,when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about, um it was with my girlfriend and uh it was about being honest uh  um i'm pretty honest with i'm open and honest about any anything and everything
492,305,mhm, and uh what it was about was uh just her lying to me uh telling me that she had told our landlord something and and that she had done something and that and that aspect and i come to find out a week later that it was a total lie so i just you know didn't like that at all
493,305,yeah,
494,305,how did you feel in that moment, pardon me
495,305,how did you feel in that moment, um i'm trying to i'm missing the word for it uh just that i don't know now that whether i could believe anything she says now so it was it was uh i felt hurt you know uh that you know here we had been in a relationship for a little bit and well that's probably one of my biggest uh pet peeves is is being honest  um i don't like i said i don't hold back and i'm pretty honest in anything and everything that i do or say so
496,305,mhm, you know and if you're lying about something well you just you're always having to cover up uh more lies with the lies that that you already told and i just don't see any you know so it kinda took a lot from uh me trusting her now or you know whatever now i'm i you know is it truthful is it not you know so it's kinda hurt our relationship
497,305,i'm sorry to hear that, can't do nothing about it
498,305,what are some things you like to do for fun, uh fun i like going to the beach uh i love shooting darts but i haven't done it in a while i i love i love to paint uh i got into watercolor painting  and i'm pretty gifted at that and um uh i wanna try some other mediums and uh let's see here i love fishing uh haven't gone in a while though and uh i like driving a truck you know uh it's you know my job you know i was a i really really enjoyed it i don't like driving through cities but uh usually when i'm in the middle of the night where i can see all the stars i like star gazing i'll see if i can um pick out some of those uh astronomy uh stars up up there and um  i'm a pretty easy going guy so shooting pool um sunshine just those i like
499,305,that's great,
500,305,what's one of your most memorable experiences, uh most memorable experiences um good or bad
501,305,whatever comes to your mind, uh most memorable experiences uh probably uh playing with lions and tigers uh uh wrestling a a baby elephant in a in a mud puddle uh
502,305,oh my gosh, uh just enjoying myself
503,305,awesome, i know
504,305,how close are you to your family, not uh i don't have much family as it is uh at least here in the states i don't my mom's from central america so uh  but i'm not close to i have uh  three brothers one sister and i'm probably not really really close to none of my siblings i speak with one brother uh quite a bit um my other youngest brother you know he he just i'd just rather not  you know i converse <con> converse with him but it's you know just i try to keep it on a professional basis my sister i don't talk to at all my my other brother underneath me i haven't spoken to him in years so i'm just close with my mom uh my niece some of my nephews and that's about it
505,305,okay could you have done anything to avoid it, have i done anything to avoid it
506,305,yes, um to avoid them
507,305,yes, uh yeah i just don't talk to them i don't call them i don't ask about them i you know i talk to my mom quite a bit my brother quite a bit but i just don't bring up those subjects or if they are brought up i just usually say you know that's on them and i really don't wanna deal with them so
508,305,i see what you mean,
509,305,how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep, um it's been hard lately it's been probably hard for the last uh going on a year um you know i uh depends on my thought process at the time i like i said i've been looking for work quite a bit um so just wondering why you know i don't get called i i just have my i have racing thoughts  so  or i get depressed you know 'cause i or i worry about things that you know that really i have no control over so
510,305,yeah, i don't lately i just been sleeping a bit too much uh at least for me because i'm so used to just sleeping four to five hours a a a night but now it's changed to about eight to nine hours and i'm still tired
511,305,mhm,
512,305,do you feel that way often, uh lately i have been probably about the last few months
513,305,what are you like when you don't sleep well, um tired <laughter> um i you know if i don't sleep well sometimes then i just dwell back on the same things that have been bothering me so you know i'm more of a guy you know i love to work um and if i'm not then it's just a little bit too much time for me to spend in my own head
514,305,mhm, and so you know um i there i either if i'm busy or i'm doing what i you know in whatever job i do i kinda you know get to it i enjoy it uh it's something new for me and uh so i can think about you know either work or i think of home and then think about this you know i don't have to worry about you know um money um you know bills are getting paid and i can just concentrate on other things either you know do the things i like or mm you know maybe spending a little bit more time with my girlfriend or you know so something like that 
515,305,mm,
516,305,how do you cope with them, how do i what
517,305,how do you cope with them, how do i cope with them um i just try not to think about it uh it's it's not about whether coping with it or not um i just do it's uh i'm more of a guy that just you know it may take me a moment to to um say that i'm coping with something but you know it it's if i have no control over it there's nothing that i can really do about it the only thing i can do is control to do what i'm doing and that's actively looking for work uh actively going out on uh  interviews
518,305,mm, uh talking with others about work so that i can just kinda you know get back to um back to basics you know i just don't let a lot of stuff bother me it does bother me but i try not to to let it continue to bother me
519,305,yeah,
520,305,has that gotten you in trouble, if what has gotten me in trouble my mood swing i mean
521,305,yeah, um yeah money i mean you know my past i i got a past history so uh which kinda tends to uh uh bother my uh my hiring process i don't know if i'm gonna get hired so i gotta deal with uh different different type of employers who are uh say uh felony friendly and uh uh stuff like that and i try you know i i've taken classes on uh  on uh how to interview how to uh how to answer some of the questions which you know come up quite a bit and uh i kinda reflect back on that but i just uh i gotta keep putting to my head that that's not who  who i wanna be anymore so or you know i i've done 
522,305,mhm, uh i've done uh i've done my time uh so to say but uh i took the time you know the last time i just took a lot of time and  and try to uh work on the issues that were bothering me so um you know toward positive stuff i got my g_e_d different things a lot of classes um uh thought about going to school  i didn't go to school and uh anything that would kinda um change my old ways and and uh and try to move on to more productive activities 
523,305,mhm,
524,305,that's good,
525,305,do you feel like therapy is useful, pardon me
526,305,do you feel like therapy is useful, i still didn't hear you
527,305,do you feel like therapy is useful, that people have been deceitful can you repeat that one more time
528,305,why don't we talk about that later, alright
529,305,have you been diagnosed with depression, uh i've been diagnosed with uh bipolarism
530,305,how hard is that, um it's tough if you don't you know um i don't medicate so i mean i have been on medication before  in the past but <sniff> um again it's i try to live on life uh i try to live life on life's terms  and i just you know
531,305,mhm, um i know the medical establishments always wanna label something and  and what i don't like about it is that they just experiment with pills you know i've been on probably every imaginable pill that there is for that and um you know some of them have been too strong or some of them not strong enough and so i just try to cope with things uh um it's just my life skills you know i i don't i don't wanna be using drug i know certain drugs work for like three to four months six months  and then they go well here i'm gonna try you on this and or i'm gonna try you on that  and it's just an ongoing process and i probably for about the last two years actually about three years i kinda just said you know what that's it and um whether it's different than whether if i would be on on on uhon meds for it   um i don't think so you know it's the still the same stuff i still get the same problems and i still  uh get the same anxiety as if i if i was on medication for it or not so i just
532,305,yeah, and i'll deal with it you know sometimes it's not good you know i get irritated at people a lot i don't like people um i don't like crowds i don't you know like obnoxious people huge empty quiet so um but i i get a person you know i it's not that personality but i think people can see me and just say uh don't mess with this guy or you know um
533,305,mm, but still you know i like i i ride public transportation quite a bit and um you know you just get a lot of loud obnoxious people on there sometimes i gotta get off the bus that's how i deal with with with with people because i just know there's consequences if i if i didn't deal with it that way 
534,305,yeah, so i just let it go i'd rather take the time on getting off the bus waiting for the next bus and hopefully it's not that bad 
535,305,i understand,
536,305,did you think you had a problem before you found out, did i have a problem before i got out
537,305,did you think you had a problem before you found out, uh well i  i don't know if i knew that i had a problem um uh before i found out the thing is that i know other people  um i have a lot of ups and downs so i know a lot in my younger days people would tell me you know when i told them that i was diagnosed with you know bipolar that um  a lot of remarks were like oh that's what's wrong you know that's what was wrong with you we we wish that you would've would've found that out years ago  uh and uh like i don't think the meds really work but what i do uh i think uh time kinda like you know just getting older kind of uh you know makes it work you know
538,305,yeah, me me dealing with life so
539,305,how has seeing a therapist affected you, pardon me
540,305,how has seeing a therapist affected you, uh i talked to a therapist probably on a weekly basis for a while uh recently and uh it helps a lot you know uh just to get out my anger uh my thoughts um a lot of people may not understand that but uh a therapist is i think the bigger thing is that i can just get it all out uh whatever's bothing me whether it be uh people you know uh uh other issues you know were whatever the case may be  i just think talking about it and they're such good listeners and can kinda like you know they they give me the same advice that you know that i you know give myself or whatever that i would give to others uh but it's always helpful if you hear it from somebody else somebody who will be has a you know are are you know they go to school for this so  you know
541,305,right, but it's good to have
542,305,that's so good to hear, yeah
543,305,what sort of changes have you noticed since you've been going to therapy, well i don't go anymore uh so um i kinda miss it you know like i said uh uh i miss it a lot actually but uh it's just one of those things you know i just deal with it you know uh according to you know if i ever get a chance to go to therapy again i probably will
544,305,why did you stop, um well monetary reasons and uh you know uh i don't have health insurance there's a lot of things that you know i'd like to do but i can't you know um 
545,305,yeah, you know money situation's not that great right now so
546,305,i'm sorry,
547,305,how would your best friend describe you, how does my friends describe me
548,305,yeah, um they would probably describe me as uh uh energetic uh outgoing person uh once i get to know people um laughs i you know i laugh a i laugh a lot
549,305,<laughter>, um but uh they would probably tell you that i'm also very serious and uh  uh hidden person i don't reveal a lot you know

577,306,uh huh,
578,306,how easy was it for you to get used to living in l_a, it is an adjustment uh to to come here a lot of people misjudge it a little bit it's a laid back appearing town but it's actually very um uh sensitive to you know uh success and commericalization and that kind of thing so you have to keep up the pace
579,306,yeah,
580,306,yeah,
581,306,how hard is that, uh that is a little bit harder i think when you first make the adjustment and pretty soon it becomes obvious that it's another market that you just have to work hard in like you you do in others
582,306,mhm,
583,306,that makes sense,
584,306,what's your dream job, oh be an attorney [laughter] mhm
585,306,really,
586,306,why, oh just because you have the uh the power you can use uh you know skills to be able to affect people live people's lives in a more dramatic way than just being uh an assistant in that field
587,306,cool,
588,306,how close are you to your family, oh uh a lot of it is not around anymore just have brothers and sisters out of state so not particularly close right now

593,306,[laughter],
594,306,that's good, mhm
595,306,when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about, oh wow uh oh just a friend a friend who is who is right now a has a fabulous job is uh spending too much money that he needs to save

601,306,mhm, and uh and see films art art galleries
602,306,okay,
603,306,who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life, oh uh my daughter
604,306,aww,
605,306,tell me about your kids, i just have one daughter who graduated u_c_l_a law school and uh i raised her totally alone without any help so it seemed like an accomplishment that was was worth it the the two jobs and the work
606,306,wow,
607,306,yeah,
608,306,do you find it easy to be a parent, uh i think it's difficult i think it's a difficult job that takes a lot more work than most people give it credit for if you wanna do it right you know it's always second guessing your behavior and that kind of thing
609,306,mhm,
610,306,what's the hardest thing about being a parent, uh just uh i'd say peer pressure it can totally alter [al] alter anything a parent has tried to put into a child that's good
611,306,yeah,
612,306,can you give me an example of that, scrubbed_entry so that was a really bad time for us
613,306,that sounds really hard,
614,306,what do you think of today's kids, um i think it depends on which neighborhood or state you're in or the the uh i i think they're a little misguided i think a little uninspired [unin] uninspired right now i think they're being weighed down by the concerns of the wars and um and things like that and i think they can probably use a  uh a common goal a common you know now a team uh as as oppposed to just being more separated group than a family [fam] once they were i think you know kind of uninspired right now
615,306,yeah,
616,306,i see what you mean,
617,306,how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep, um i worry sometimes about you know work issues but it's pretty pretty easy
618,306,do you feel that way often, um no i i don't feel like i'm not sleeping i i just you know will occasionally worry about something at work
619,306,when was the last time that happened, oh gosh about a couple weeks ago
620,306,how did you feel in that moment, oh just uh you know unfortunately we have to worry you know i'm fortunate this isn't easier it's just cooperation between people uh it solves most everything you know so you always wanna have that around you
621,306,mhm,
622,306,what are you like when you don't sleep well, um just stressed yeah stressed more stressed
623,306,that sounds really hard, mhm
624,306,do you feel down, um yeah fatigue has uh a lot of uh you know a lot of implications for just not feeling like yourself or misjudging things that you might judge differently if you were more well rested
625,306,yeah,
626,306,have you been diagnosed with depression, uh not depression
627,306,have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d, um probably yeah i was that was considered a possibility i had an employment lawsuit several years ago and and uh actually litigated it and won the settlement um something about whistleblower thing implications [im] implications of that and um and i was kind of harrassed about it and so i found when i got out of it i couldn't find work right away in my own field so i had to go into a different field go back to u_c_l_a and get a new uh professional direction and i found myself fearful sometimes that it's gonna happen again you know and you think that would never happen again you know
628,306,mhm,
629,306,i'm sorry to hear that,
630,306,what got you to seek help, um just that i was noticing that i was noticing i was feeling very uh in my paralegal class i had a a section about employment law and there was a a very complicated filing i had done with great a deal of work and study for my case but once faced with it again in that class setting i just i just couldn't get it done it was a late paper from me and i realized i was traumatized by having to go through that again um that you know yeah post traumatic stress sometimes comes later after the adrenaline dies down
631,306,yeah, from what i understand and um so i think it was just uh it was just hitting me later you know that i was having to face that paper again and wow you know no adrenaline just wow there is a xxxx
632,306,hmm, back back
633,306,what were your symptoms, just uh just extreme uh you know avoidance of getting something done that should've been easy for me  and uh and thinking about it as thoroughly as i should've or studying it or putting it off uh putting the feeling of going through that paper that type of paper even if it's just a class assignment again you know
634,306,yeah,
635,306,have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately, well um not lately um you know back then for sure when that happened which was about ten years ago now it was settled in court about seven years ago now and uh yeah it was it was effective you know it was effective in the way you view most everything and in your confidence and that kinda thing
636,306,do you feel like therapy is useful, i'm sorry [laughter] repeat the question
637,306,do you feel like therapy is useful, uh peaceful do i feel peaceful well yeah i was peaceful that it that it's settled uh but but angry that it ever happened so it's hard to i'll probably not ever feel peaceful about that issue ever it always the mention of it always makes me angry that i had to go through that yeah
638,306,yeah,
639,306,could you have done anything to avoid it, i don't think so i tried everything to avoid it [laughter] you know and so uh uh i think that's that was aggravating for me too because i'm a patient person realistic and um and i tried everything to avoid uh confrontation in the matter but it was just required to try to you know help me cover the damage to our lives my daughter's life
640,306,yeah,
641,306,do you consider yourself an introvert, i uh not now maybe one time in my life not now you if you can't communicate uh you know if you could communicate you could overcome people's perceptions or their judgments of you if you can effectively explain something and and uh it will help you overcome other perceptions of yourself that others might normally have judgments for age or anything like that
642,306,yeah,
643,306,what's one of your most memorable experiences, um well just raising a daughter extendedly you know or or uh you know just um the experience of thinking thinking that that was a after all the years that was a success her graduating from law school yeah
644,306,yeah,
645,306,how did you feel in that moment, uh just like a lot of work had a good ending uh  you know happy glad that it was fulfilled wishes or or dreams for this child were fulfilled you know that and she was able to make that success
646,306,that's great,
647,306,when was the last time you felt really happy, wow um [laughter] i i i tend to be kind of happy with life 'cause the alternative is gonna harm harm your you know your ability to succeed so i try to force happiness i guess in in most every situation in my life route i find something about it uh when i lost some weight recently that made me really happy
648,306,wow,
649,306,that's great,
650,306,do you travel a lot, i travel a little bit locally i traveled more when i was younger i really enjoyed that but just been too busy in the last few years
651,306,yeah what do you enjoy about traveling, just new places um ability to take the worries we have every day work  or concerns and kind of put them away for a while and see something new  you know kind of the way
652,306,i'd love to hear about one of your trips, i'm going back to uh colorado san riosco went through vale  and uh and spent the night there and um and it was just during spring when there aren't many skiiers and it was just beautiful and very quiet a lot of restaurants with the decks and open in the mountains and it was beautiful
653,306,that sounds like a great situation, yeah
654,306,how would your best friend describe you, wow uh just um ardent i'm hard working loyal uh um creative
655,306,okay what's the best thing about being a parent, um just seeing something that you're creating you're trying to create uh becomes something you hoped the picture would be you know if if that's the case you know just hard work uh just fulfilled or or presented itself in a certain way that you know it makes you happy
656,306,yeah,
657,306,how close are you to them, to my daughter um very [ver] pretty close she just had a baby she's in the bay area she send me pictures all the time
658,306,aww,

662,306,goodbye,
663,307,hi i'm ellie thanks for coming in today i was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment think of me as a friend i don't judge i can't i'm a computer   ,
664,307,i'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you i'll ask a few questions to get us started and please feel free to tell me anything your answers are totally confidential , <laughter>
665,307,where are you from originally, um moscow
666,307,really,
667,307,why'd you move to l_a, um my family moved to the u_s and then i moved down here eventually for college
668,307,how easy was it for you to get used to living in l_a,  uh it took a long time to i've been living here for about a year since i graduated so there's been a lot of ups and downs but finally gotten adjusted to it so it took a while though
669,307,that's good,
670,307,how do you like your living situation, it goes off and on i have two roommates and there's always a little bit of drama here and there between
671,307,[laughter], the girls but for the most part after a year and a couple months i think we finally learned how to live together but it was pretty much like a reality t_v show for a while
672,307,yeah,
673,307,how do you know them, one's from college and the other one we found on craigslist
674,307,how close are you to them, it varies depending on whether or not we're mad at each other so um i guess pretty close right now we're kinda distant
675,307,aww,
676,307,tell me more about that, oh about the distant
677,307,yes, okay um well we  haven't seen each other we haven't hung out in like two weeks 'cause one of them got into like this car accident and um so she's been distant since then and kinda locks herself up in her room
678,307,uh oh, and the other one is always working late so we just our our scheduling has been off and no one's really made an attempt to hang out with anyone so it's kind of we're just waiting for someone i guess to make the first move 
679,307,yeah that sucks, it's okay it'll get better
680,307,yeah,
681,307,how are you at controlling your temper, it depends with whom  i'm dealing with i guess i would say with some people i guess with my family not very good my boyfriend it's not very good but with other people that i might not know so well then i'm able to control it a little bit more but it'll be more passive aggressive than like full on anger
682,307,why, oh 'cause i don't want them to see me as a bitch [laughter]
683,307,[laughter],
684,307,that makes sense, yeah
685,307,who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life, uh probably my best friend nicole she's probably been we've been best friends for like god since high school freshman year of high school is when we first met so long time so yeah
686,307,wow, um
687,307,can you give me an example of that, of of what 
688,307,how do you know them, uh my friend nicole
689,307,yeah, um we met in french class freshman year of high school we were in the same class and then we kinda started doing homework together and we had a lot of class the same classes together and so we just kinda started hanging out and then we just became closer and have stayed really close since then
690,307,nice, mhm
691,307,what are some things you like to do for fun, um uh going out with friends going to bars going dancing biking hiking staying active um going to the movies going out to eat at restaurants uh photography um just hanging out with friends i guess whatever
692,307,okay,
693,307,how close are you to your family, uh it varies like i'm really close to them when it comes to things about like school work um those kinds of things but when it comes to relationships and friendships and more personal personal things  i don't really discuss that with them
694,307,mm, so i guess superficially close
695,307,okay, but i rely on them a lot so we're close i guess
696,307,that's good, mhm
697,307,what are some things that make you really mad, uh that's a good question um i guess it depends who it is again i guess people who are inconsiderate unthoughtful flakey ignorant and uh conceited [cons] uh yeah i guess those kinds of people and when people just um what makes me mad that's a good question i guess a lot of things make me mad [laughter] but it's mostly how people react to um different situations can make me angry i guess
698,307,yeah,
699,307, when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about, uh yesterday and it was my boyfriend and we argued because he's trying to be healthy and workout and save money  and so and so by doing that what he does is he orders pizza in so he's not saving money and he's not being healthy and so i got frustrated with him 'cause i'm constantly trying to push him to be healthy and each time he's like i'm gonna do it i'm gonna do it so he's constantly breaking promises that's another thing that makes me angry is people that don't follow through
700,307,[laughter],
701,307,yeah,
702,307,do you feel that way often, about other people or about myself or angry
703,307,whatever comes to your mind, xxxx [laughter] um angry i guess i'll go with that no i don't feel angry often
704,307,okay,
705,307,what's your dream job, dang it that is a tough one how 'bout just getting paid to be me um i don't know that what i'm kind of trying to figure out right now 'cause i quit my full time job 'cause i hated it it was just mostly sitting in an office all day which i thought was extremely boring so now i work in a restaurant job and i'm trying to look for a second job to support myself um  my dream job i don't know what it would be but i know it would involve people and i'd love to have some kind of like finished product or some kind of accomplishment towards the end i guess it's something that i realized i like to see the result from all my hard work 'cause i majored in sociology and as much as i loved that major is you realize it's a whole lot of theorizing and arguing but with no real solution so it's just like at the end all you have is just these theoretical elements that you can't really do anything with and nothing to show for your work except for a piece of paper with your essays or notes so
706,307,mhm,
707,307,yeah, something to do with people and maybe something artistic i love photography i love cooking baking in particularly so i don't know something in that realm i guess
708,307,okay,
709,307,do you travel a lot, i used to travel a lot my family is known for traveling we've gone to gosh seven eight different countries i've lived in three or four different countries
710,307,wow, i haven't traveled a lot lately just because i have no money and jobs kinda tie you down but i would love to have that i guess my dream job would be a photographer that for national geographic that would be awesome
711,307,yeah, um or a huge photographer that travels that'd be awesome too but anyways um yeah i do travel a lot
712,307,what do you enjoy about traveling, in the new places new faces new experiences i get restless very easily so it's nice to constantly be on the move and see different things and see different cultures and types of people and just not get stuck in the same routine i hate the routine and mundaneness of everyday life so it's nice to stir things up
713,307,i see what you mean,
714,307,i'd love to hear about one of your trips, oh gosh okay um i'm trying to think one of my trips i guess we can talk about i don't know it's funny even though i've been to lots of different countries one of my most memorable memorable trips is one of the trips that i took with my family i was a three week roadtrip with my family there's five of us packed in a tiny little station wagon
715,307,oh my gosh, i know needless to say it's like when you're that close proximity for three weeks camping you start getting on each others' nerves but it was really fun and like even though i've traveled so many places i realized that there's like such a beauty in the american landscape and so we were all around the southwest and the grand canyon to zion to the grand tetons to yellowstone and it was absolutely amazing just seeing all that natural beauty so um and we saw a grizzly bear black bear lots of bison a wolf and it was really cool those kinds of i don't know natural wonders also really amaze me 'cause those things aren't man made and as as pretentious as it sounds after a while europe kinda gets not old but it's like you know you get the same idea like white old white men building great buildings and art work and it's beautiful and all but like you just kind of like okay i wanna see something that's natural and beautiful or something that's different too
716,307,yeah,
717,307,i see what you mean, cool
718,307,how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep, um pretty easy as long as I get well no i always sleep so easy
719,307,what are you like when you don't sleep well, oh grumpy and just very lethargic and just low energy don't say much and just kinda off in my own world
720,307,do you feel that way often, i not not anymore i usually get enough sleep and i've been working out more so it's kind of  energizing me so no it's not too bad that's good
721,307,have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately, uh i guess i've just been more negative but it has to do with like circumstances kind of like uh it's been about five months since i quit my full time job haven't found anything else haven't really found anything else i'm interested in so it's more of just like ugh what am i doing da da da that kind of thing
722,307,yeah,
723,307,it can be tough to find a good job these days, yeah it's it is hard the market and just like i'm very picky 'cause i don't wanna just sittin in a little my own cubicle 'cause i quit my job exactly for that reason so why go back to another job just do the same exact thing that i quit my other job for
724,307,mhm, so it's just like i have to make it worthwhile that i quit my last job to get a better job so it's just kinda like i'm stuck in this section of just like living paycheck to paycheck barely making it and just waiting for the right opportunity to come across but it's like when do i give up and sell my soul and go back to the corporate world of sitting in little cubicles i don't know
725,307,that sounds really hard, yeah it is hard but i mean i guess everyone goes through that same situation after college so but i guess it's tough 'cause a lot of my friends 'cause i went to a pretty good school and you know i have a friend who's teaching english in afghanistan and i have another one who's met the president you know and one that's doing teach for america another friend who's in harvard uh school for like harvard masters [mass] you know getting her masters so it's kind of like ahh all that comparison and then here i am working a little restaurant job so
726,307,yeah,
727,307,do you feel down, uh i do sometimes yes but i'm going to hawaii next week so right now i'm fine [laughter]
728,307,nice, yes but yeah usually it's been kind of like down because i'm just trying to find like what i'm supposed to like you know what do i want to do next and like money situations which is very stressful especially when you have school loans to pay off insurance rent car loans like it's just groceries like i can't even afford groceries so it's just hard to like live this way especially after you've paid so much money for like an amazing college education so it's a little bit frustrating but there's a lot of people in the same situation
729,307,yeah,
730,307,i'm sorry, it's all good
731,307,have you been diagnosed with depression, uh no i don't think so but i mean i think everyone goes through depression here and there so i don't know if you can but not like medically diagnose i'm not on meds
732,307,okay,
733,307,have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d, nope
734,307,have you ever served in the military, nope
735,307,okay,
736,307,what advice would you give yourself ten or twenty years ago, oh let's see uh to try lots of different things and not be afraid to fail 'cause i'm one of those people if i'm not gonna be the best at something then i'm just not gonna try i accept the best or nothing at all go big or go home so but i think i would've told my high school self that go and try lots of things even if it means i'm not gonna be the best at it so ten years ago
737,307,like what, well that would've made me like twelve so  [laughter] um i used to do a lot of things i i used to act i think i would've continued doing that i used to write a lot when i was younger i used to write miniature like little stories  short stories for my parents all the time and i kind of stopped doing those things 'cause it's like oh i'm not good at it so i'm not gonna do it and i think if i just continued doing those things and tried you know different classes  um i don't know different sports i kinda just stuck with soccer growing up i don't know just expand myself more rather than like find something i'm good at and just stay with it but never really try harder kinda just like stay i always kinda stayed at one level but once i'm good i just stay for good i don't try to go above that if that makes any sense
738,307,yeah,
739,307,yeah,
740,307,what do you do to relax, uh right now it's super lame but i watch t_v [laughter] but i used to read a i used to read on my off time or just listen to music or just take a nap or bake but now it's just like since i'm on my feet all day and like constantly interacting with people i just kinda wanna unwind by like sitting and lying on the couch and being like i'm done so
741,307,yeah,
742,307,what's one of your most memorable experiences , [laughter] that's a tough question um probably the day i got accepted into pomona college um i was a freshman at wellesley college which is the women's college back east and i hated it from like the second from like the first week i just knew that i chose the wrong college and i was like miserable for the entire year
743,307,aww, and i only only applied to one school to transfer pomona college like that's out in claremont and um i didn't think i was gonna get in and i was 'cause it was like a four percent acceptance rate and i was like what are the chances like this is ridiculous i don't think i'm gonna get in and i was like you know the thought of going back to wellesley was super depressing 
744,307,mhm, um but then i got an email from one of the admission counselors that i had met when i was visiting pomona and he was like hi tatiana like um just wanted to see if you had any last minute questions about pomona hope all is well and i was like why would he be emailing me the day we find out if we got you know accepted or not um unless i got the acceptance and so sure enough a couple hours later i got the email that i was accepted into pomona and i was ecstatic that was like that best day of my life i was so happy that's probably one
745,307,that's great, yeah it was awesome then i took my mom and my little brother out to dinner and i went and bought myself some new dresses went and just like went crazy dyed my hair pierced my nose i was like let's start this whole thing over so [laughter]
746,307,awesome, yeah
747,307,how would your best friend describe you, bubbly  fun  maybe moody you never know what you're gonna get sometimes um
748,307,[laughter], probably   uh definitely friendly um and pretty like a positive person um but sometimes maybe a little bit aggressive but for the most part i think positive things i mean she's my best friend so [laughter]

1107,312,<laughter>, okay i'm cutting you off
1108,312,do you travel a lot, not as much as i used to
1109,312,why, um i used to be in school i used to travel a lot of places for conferences and things like that but i'm not in school right now but later on i'll get back into school and i'll travel more but right no doubt
1110,312,what do you enjoy about traveling, i don't i don't enjoy traveling
1111,312,what'd you study at school, uh that's a good question you're actually pretty good um i studied physics and aerospace engineering but physics mainly
1112,312,are you still working in that, yes i am actually
1113,312,what do you do now, right now i teach community college physics and astronomy uh but i still do research in physics also because i like that type of thing and i'm going back to grad school hopefully that's why i'm nervous sometimes on the questionnaire
1114,312,awesome, impressive
1115,312,what's your dream job, professor at a place like u_s_c or u_c or l_a or like that where the professors do three hours of work a week and the grad students do the rest
1116,312,<laughter>, you're actually pretty good at this
1117,312,who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life, <sigh> i there's a lot of people the the first one i guess is my physics teacher in a_p physics teacher in high school even though he led me to be an engineer instead of a physics major um he still was a very good influence he told me you know he's the first one who taught me that school was not about a grade but about learning
1118,312,mhm,
1119,312,that's so good to hear, okay
1120,312,how are you at controlling your temper, i'm pretty good i think
1121,312,when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about, i'm single so i don't get in many arguments um but it's probably my brother about he always like to uh play a video game together i know i'm pretty old to play video games but they're actually pretty good um it's probably something like that and me getting angry at him and him trying to defend himself and me being right that's all
1122,312,okay,
1123,312,how close are you to your family, fairly close um i see them pretty  pretty often parents i see a couple times a week they're getting older so i've been helping with groceries things like that and my brother i see  same same with him same amount <amo> same time my sister i tutor her kids my nephews uh so i see 'em about once a week also
1124,312,aw,
1125,312,that's good, interesting
1126,312,do you consider yourself an introvert, yes
1127,312,why, because i spend long periods of time doing math and reading and not talking to anybody that's introverted
1128,312,i see what you mean,
1129,312,what do you do to relax, i guess i play video games or and i work out i work out i think a lot i try to at least
1130,312,cool,
1131,312,what do you do when you're annoyed, i roll my eyes which i've been told is a bad thing um and that's about it i think
1132,312,okay,
1133,312,what do you think of today's kids, <deep breath> bad parenting basically parents are more self-centered more to themselves unlike previous generations and the kids just  do what they want because the parents aren't there for <fo> the parents aren't being parents in my personal <per> own personal opinion
1134,312,mm,
1135,312,that makes sense,
1136,312,what's one of your most memorable experiences , <sigh> um i guess scrubbed_entry um scrubbed_entry scrubbed_entry
1137,312,awesome, thank you
1138,312,how would your best friend describe you, i don't really have a best friend introverted remember
1139,312,okay,
1140,312,what would you say are some of your best qualities, i'm biased obviously but they are i'm really good in math i'm not really sure if you can't not saying you can't get better than me in math but thing is it's just that you get reach a certain confidence with it where no matter what it is you need to learn in math you can always figure it out um i am patient i think and i am disciplined where i can spend i can spend many hours many many many hours reading books that might not be important but they might be important so i have to do it anyway that type of thing
1141,312,what are some things that usually put you in a good mood, when i a good workout  doing well in video games small little things like that um what's really happy is when my my research type thing mathematical or physics type thing when it goes well that must puts me in a mood <mo> that puts me in a good mood
1142,312,nice, thank you
1143,312,what are you most proud of in your life, right now it's the fact that research that i did i did make it this far research wise that's all that's all
1144,312,tell me more about that, interesting um when you start off in school you read about einstein and things like that it's he's this general xxx hero particle physics and you have no idea what it is and you know it's very complicated things like quantum mechanics and you still haven't realized you're interested in that and but you're not sure if you can actually make it and eventually each step as a lot of time goes by you wish you as time goes on you can get closer and closer eventually make the goal eventually you realize you are just not as good as einstein but you are up there you can do research in physics you can add to mass knowledge in science and that's impressive that you you don't see yourself doing that when you're a kid
1145,312,yeah, okay
1146,312,when was the last time you felt really happy, um a few weeks ago when i got a good grade in a class
1147,312,cool, thank you
1148,312,have you ever served in the military, yes briefly  many years ago <ag> yes
1149,312,really,
1150,312,why'd you decide to enlist in the military, i don't know it just always growing up i always thought that was i always thought it was my dream when i was a kid that's why and i just went about doing that 
1151,312,how old were you when you joined the military, um i was a national guard i think about eighteen nineteen i got commissioned at twenty twenty one and i was only in for about a year so i left at twenty twenty two

1237,313,can you give me an example of that, um i mean it depends on what you mean by therapy like i or most people probably can't afford good therapy but just even talking to friends i would consider therapy somebody who will listen so helps you get stuff off your chest 
1238,313,that's so good to hear, <clears throat> thanks
1239,313,how has seeing a therapist affected you , um well i haven't necessarily seen a therapist per se but uh when you talk to somebody who listens and you and you get stuff like out there like out of your head or whatever it it's uh it helps to destress i think

1269,314,really, mhm one of the few um native born los angelinos

1271,314,yeah,
1272,314,what do you do now, i uh home school my ten year old son and uh i'm a home maker i have five children and married twenty two years
1273,314,wow, mhm
1274,314,do you travel a lot, so that's a full time job huh
1275,314,do you travel a lot, uh somewhat we can we went to israel about two months ago um for a pilgrimmage with our church yeah so i would say yes i've traveled a bit
1276,314,i'd love to hear about one of your trips, uh well most recently we like two months ago went to israel for a pilgrimmage we were gone about nine days and it was fabulous it was we spent the first five days in chorazine which is near the uh galilee and in a place called uh uh i mean the the name of the area is chorazine but uh we stayed in a place called adonis galilea which is a um a house for that welcomes um christian uh pilgrims as well as jewish pilgrims
1277,314,that's so good to hear,
1278,314,what do you enjoy about traveling, um i i enjoy like really the most important thing i enjoy is like meeting the people and and of course seeing the the history i mean especially israel i mean it's the  it's totally ancient but um most most i enjoy is is the the people i think to uh get a better understanding of how different cultures um live
1279,314,okay,
1280,314,do you consider yourself an introvert, no not at all
1281,314,why, just don't i you know all my life i've always been open and and uh willing to socialize and i remember my younger brother always um joking and saying that i i would talk to anybody and i will i'll talk to just about anybody just because i enjoy learning about other people
1282,314,that's good,
1283,314,what do you do to relax, um most of the time like by the end of the day after i've cooked dinner and we've had dinner together as a family um i there's a word game on the computer that i like to play for a little while and then um watch t_v have a cocktail with my husband and just relax that's what we do and you know 'cause we have a lot going on we don't stay up too late so i like to watch crime dramas
1284,314,nice,
1285,314,what are some things that make you really mad, um really mad probably not a lot um i get frustrated with for example my daughter does not clean up her room almost ever so that that gets me angry but um in terms of like really um getting like heatedly angry i mean other than like little things that my children do to you know especially my oldest child who's twenty one you know he can be confrontational so other than that nothing gets me like really angry haven't i haven't haven't felt that
1286,314,okay,
1287,314,what's the best thing about being a parent, um contributing to society helping uh helping to raise um responsible people i guess um and of course the love and the affection and the um the fun and the excitement that goes with it of all the stages that go i mean like really right now i'm in a stage where my children are either adults or teenagers i only have i have one eleven year old and the rest are all teenagers and adults so it's really fun because we're able to um talk about current events and all kinds of stuff that's going on in the world and you know have have uh challenging discussions and that sort of thing so it's it's a different level than when you're taking care of babies and you know changing diapers and that kind of stuff
1288,314,uh huh,
1289,314,what's the hardest thing about being a parent, the hardest thing is that it's twenty four seven um you're never not a parent you know it's and so you have to accept that and that's i remember when i first with my first child um thinking you know when i brought him home from the hospital this is it i mean there's no going back you you cannot um change i mean i guess you could if you did something horrible but i mean under normal circumstances you can't change um that and it's a permanent thing and um it it it uh in some ways it takes away your freedom but in other ways it give you a different sort of freedom
1290,314,i see what you mean,
1291,314,there are always tradeoffs in life aren't there, mhm always
1292,314,who's someone that's been a positive influence in  your life, i'm sorry i didn't get what you said
1293,314,what are some things you like to do for fun who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life , um some of the things that've been a positive influence in my life most importantly my church um and my faith uh but also my husband he's been a really um he's kind of he's very like logical thinking and very you know grounded so when if i get emotional or i get upset about something he's always we balance each other out likewise if he's upset about something i'm able to balance him out it's been a that's been a a great gift in my life
1294,314,how are you at controlling your temper, um i don't i i don't think i'd be categorized as somebody with a a temper um occasionally i i occasionally i get angry but i don't like have like rarely do i have outbursts um i'm more more likely to you know to say what i feel not let it build up so with you know like my husband and i don't rarely fight like have arguments that are yelling and screaming or anything like that it almost never happens because i i like i said i'm more of a type of person that communicates on the spot so if i'm thinking something i usually communicate it right away instead of letting it build up
1295,314,that's good,
1296,314,when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about, um usually i'm arguing with my older son because he um you know he thinks he knows everything he's twenty one years old so he has the know it all mentality  and i'm just telling him that he doesn't know it all and you know as life goes on he'll learn more he's very confident and very self uh self uh what's the word self assured and so he thinks that you know everything he does is correct and he still has a lot of learning to do that's all
1297,314,that sounds really hard, mhm it is it can be mhm
1298,314,what do you think of today's kids, i think um that many of them are um spoiled and live in an environment of uh of instant gratification um which i think is gonna be um detrimental to the to the future of this country but um you know given that with all the technology we have there's really not any way to go back so i i have um hope that um they will i mean i think this country was built on on uh hard work and and ethics and uh hopefully our our the next generation and the the generations after that can maintain that um that standard of living i don't know if it's possible
1299,314,yeah,
1300,314,how would your best friend describe you, mm as loving nurturing um funny we laugh a lot and um caring honest things that uh i mean my best i have  well actually my best friend is it's two people it's two sisters that i grew up with and um we i for some years took care of their mother who has alzheimers before my parents got sick so i had a very close have a very close relationship with them still do and so um i'm considered the fourth sister so i would say that those are my best friends and and um we love each other very much it's a good relationship
1301,314,aw,
1302,314,have you ever served in the military, no
1303,314,have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d, no
1304,314,have you been diagnosed with depression, yes most
1305,314,how long ago were you diagnosed, mostly mm minorly depression it was more anxiety um probably um um it's probably been five or six years i mean i've had if off and on all my life but it was never diagnosed originally like as a teenager i think is when i first had started with the anxiety but
1306,314,mhm, um other than that i i you know so depression kind of goes with anxiety if it's not under control um but now it's under control so i have a great
1307,314,are they triggered by something, huh
1308,314,are they triggered by something, um no i think it was what they call free [flee] float free floating anxiety more of a of of uh organic um reason for it in other words there there was a chemical imbalance 
1309,314,oh, in my brain
1310,314,how have you been feeling lately, i've been feeling pretty good actually the holidays were great um we had a  good family gatherings a little stressed because um we're making a big decision right now to help my parents out um my dad is really sick um and we've offered to move in with them they have a big home but we would have to do a lot of some renovation and some to help and some obviously moving around and so we're in the throws of that and um so that's a big big change but i'm looking forward to it because really don't want my parents to be alone as they get they're in their eighties so as they get closer to death i want to have my family there with them
1311,314,i understand,
1312,314,how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep, um not easy usually all of my life i think i've always i mean i'm not i've always had um at least i wake up at least once in the middle of the night
1313,314,why, um to go to the bathroom basically
1314,314,oh, and uh other than that i mean no now i sleep well i mean other than that i sleep well but sometimes if i wake up like really early in the morning then i can't go back to sleep  i'll get up and maybe do some work on the computer and then go back to bed and go back to sleep idepends on what my schedule is and if the kids are have to be at the school early and there's a lot of factors
1315,314,that sucks, yeah sometimes it does
1316,314,what are you like when you don't sleep well, mm probably basically the same i think i might complain a bit like oh i'm tired or my body hurts or whatever you know but um i think overall probably the same my kids know i'll be i'll tell me kids oh i'm really tired and they'll understand my older daughter will be really helpful
1317,314,okay, they my other daughter will try to cook dinner or something like that so you know they may pitch in a little bit more
1318,314,uh huh,
1319,314,have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately, uh not really not not no not really not anything significant
1320,314,do you feel like therapy is useful, huh
1321,314,do you feel like therapy is useful, um actually yes i do i do feel like therapy is useful
1322,314,tell me more about that, um well uh we had a situation with my daughter um she also suffers from anxiety and um we have had her in therapy for some time and we just recently we're about to finish a group with her that was a six month um uh group for d_b_t it's called and it's like a  it's the first time they it's the first time they're documenting using it with teenagers and um it's been really good it's been very helpful it's just all about how to live in the moment and how to you know actual physical and mental um strategies to keep your uh keep you from your mind from going crazy you know worrying about things or you know in this case some of the kids have tried to harm themselves or whatever so um that's the focus of the therapy and it's been really good my husband and i both have been going with our daughter and it's been really um really informational and really helpful i think
1323,314,that's so good to hear,
1324,314,what got you to seek help, oh my daughter was um she was in a bad way she was you know suffering a lot and we knew it and um we acted on it that's all
1325,314,that's great,
1326,314,when was the last time you felt really happy, um like really joyful and happy i would say probably when probably it would be in israel when we renewed our marriage vows in the the at the in knaan
1327,314,aw,  uh so um you know where the wedding of kana took place that was really moving and beautiful um and it was it happened that our anniversary was we left on our anniversary day flew to israel so it was right at the same time it was beautiful
1328,314,wow, very meaningful and other than that i would say you know like uh other joyful occasions have been you know like christmas and you know family gatherings and you know my dad's birthday turned eighty three on christmas eve you know that kinda thing so
1329,314,what are some things that usually put you in a good mood, um um that's an interesting question i would say um once i get like things done that i need to do like if i'm have a lot of chores [ch] a lot of either work to do around the house or errands to run once i get them done i feel like a sense of accomplishment you know much like i mean i worked for many years in a as an administrative manager at u_c_l_a and um you know once you get a project done or you get your whatever month end stuff done or if there's a lot of different things you have to meet deadlines there's uh that feeling of like yeah i got it done you know so i think that would be you know for me the most um most recent um way of feeling good and feeling you know like feeling accomplished
1330,314,mhm,
1331,314,what's your dream job, dream job hm i think i've already lived it i'm also a birth doula and um
1332,314,really, yeah and um so i've attended a lot of births and now i really only do it for family and friends and um it's the most rewarding thing you could possibly ask to be involved in the birth the bringing of new life into this world so i would say that's probably was my was a dream job and i didn't know it i trained much after you know i did my managerial stuff and um was awesome it is and was awesome so i don't work at at a hospital anymore actually the hospital that i worked at is now closed but um i like i said i do it for family members
1333,314,what made you decide to do that, um i attended a friend of mine's birth by accident she uh she had had the same o_b as i did with all my children and um i came to bring food for her husband when she was in labor we were you know close friends and her labor picked up quite a bit when i got there you know she wanted me to stay she didn't want me to leave i hadn't planned on it so that was the first birth that i had attended outside of you know myself giving birth which is a whole different experience so after that i was really interesting interested in possibly study un nurse midwifery
1334,314,uh huh, but then i discovered this thing called being a doula which is really gives you even a lot more hands on uh one on one contact with the patient which is what i like so i trained to do that at at a hospital in inglewood um about fifteen years ago 'cause my son is fifteen and he was a year old no sixteen he was a year old so um yeah and i've been
1335,314,how hard is that, um well it can be challenging in terms of hours it depends on how long the woman's in labor but uh and you know also like for me i always tell my friends and family if they want me to be their doula that i cannot guarantee a hundred percent i'm not doing it for business and that way and because of that i don't have like back up doulas that in case i'm sick or unavailable somebody else can fill in for me so um but so far it's been that all the women that've asked me i've been able to be there for some reason so the um the uh the only one that i missed was one a friend of mine from church she wanted me to go with her second baby i was with her for her first but the labor went so fast she didn't even call me [laughter]  it was in the middle of the night she was like 
1336,314,wow, two hours of labor she wouldn't even if she had called me i wouldn't have been there in time [laughter] so um
1337,314,[laughter], it went really fast but other than that you know um yeah i've been been been able to attend all the births of people that have asked me to do
1338,314,what's one of your most memorable experiences, um in all of life or in your job
1339,314,whatever comes to your mind, uh probably my my own birth i mean my the birth of my own children
1340,314,how did you feel in that moment, um like there's an extreme sense of joy excitement relief because of course you're out of the pain and then like it's just it's just a matter of you know going forward from there but it's it's like something you can't explain it's it's just it's awesome after you give birth
1341,314,that sounds like a great situation, and i have experienced both ways i've done both um natural and my last child was via c_section so i've had both both um experiences
1342,314,mhm,
1343,314,is there anything you regret, um i with my third child i had kind of a crazy nurse she was a little psychotic but other than that we laugh about it now but when i was in labor it wasn't funny
1344,314,[laughter], and um she she was not there when the doctor i mean it was my my third child was born very quickly after he broke the water and oof my husband was there but she was not nor was the doctor and she got in a lot of trouble because i only had like two contractions after that
1345,314,oh no, my daughter was born in the bed so for me it was great 'cause i didn't have to go through any of the labor but um i'm sure they weren't happy to fill out a lot of paper work after that
1346,314,yeah, so
1347,314,what advice would you give yourself ten or twenty years ago, now would i give mysef for ten or twenty years ago um ten or twenty years ago i was probably more not as um relaxed not as um like i feel now at my age that um i i don't have the same concerns that i did then i don't worry about uh i don't worry at all about what people think about me i don't worry at all about what you know you know like my i noticed my daughter's oh mom you can't wear that because people are gonna say this i just say i don't care you know but they do because it's still in their frame of mind that that oh mom you have to dress like this and dress like that whatever so that would probably be it the wisdom that you you achieve with age that you you see how life there are so many things that are more important in life than worrying about little things
1348,314,that makes sense, what are you most proud of in your life most proud of um probably my family my my husband and my my children i mean the fact that we've stayed married that we've we're an in tact family that um my kids see every day how their friends suffer who come from divorced families or single parents and they um they actually express gratitude sometimes that we are married and we still you know we are still a family so i would say that's probably it
1349,314,that's great,
1350,314,what would you say are some of your best qualities, um probably the one of my best qualities is uh being able to listen to people and being able to um not be judgmental um through the years i've had a  a lot of experience with um people with problems a lot of friends with problems people i know from church and it's just taught me that um everybody has weaknesses everybody has problems and um i don't think i'm better than someone else if you think you're better than someone else then that's usually um to me a sign that you don't know yourself well enough

2162,323,mhm, done a lot more when it comes to that 
2163,323,could you have done anything to avoid it  , yes that's that's that's why it's a regret because it could've been avoided there's things we could've done and we were spending our time working and more concerned about getting ahead than actually family and what's closest to us     i think that people <peop> most people

2300,325,yeah,
2301,325,yeah,
2302,325,what'd you study at school, i just graduated actually um i studied marine biology
2303,325,wow,
2304,325,that sounds interesting,
2305,325,how did you decide to do that, i was i went to school and i orginally studied um graphic design and i found that kind of unfulfilling so i took a trip for a while traveled around the world and started scuba diving and i realized that i really loved marine biology so that's how i got into it 
2306,325,nice,
2307,325,what's your dream job, everybody's been asking me that a lot lately since i just graduated i think i would like to <exhaling>  um i think maybe managing a um managing a research you know i'm not i'm not really sure i think i would like to something in tropical marine ecology maybe like managing a preserve um something like that it's a hard question to answer <laughter>
2308,325,okay,
2309,325,do you travel a lot, i do um
2310,325,what do you enjoy about traveling, i like meeting new people and seeing different parts of the world
2311,325,i'd love to hear about one of your trips, well i traveled for eight months in central america um and i visited a lot of different countries i um i went scuba diving
2312,325,wow,
2313,325,what are some things that make you really mad, i think um i think intolerance injustice in the world those are probably the things that get me the most fired up
2314,325,mhm,
2315,325,what do you do when you're annoyed, vent to my boyfriend does that count <laughter>
2316,325,<laughter>,
2317,325,yes,
2318,325,how are you at controlling your temper, i'm pretty good it takes it takes a lot to really get me um fired up to the point where i i kinda blow my top the very few people that have seen me angry um to the point where i'm kind of yelling and screaming angry um i don't know i just don't get there i think that i'm a little bit afraid of losing my temper so i keep it under control 
2319,325,that's good,
2320,325,when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about, <laughter> it was yesterday actually i argued with my boyfriend um about uh getting getting a job i was talking about taking a job somewhere and he was being very supportive and i really wanted him to to say no don't go take that job for six months 'cause i would miss you and he was just being supportive so um we kind of argued about that <laughter> and it was ridiculous so we i ended up laughing and that was the end of the fight
2321,325,aww,
2322,325,that's good,
2323,325,what do you do to relax, um meditate excercise go out in nature just um unplug get myself away from the computer away from technology away from people 
2324,325,okay,
2325,325,how close are you to your family, i would say not really um i'm an only child and it's just me and my parents and we're very very dissimilar for example um i'm a pretty adventurous person and i like learning and my parents are uh couch potatoes they like to watch reality television so we don't have too much to talk about or things that we can really do um as far as shared activites so you know i love them and everything but there's not too much common ground
2326,325,i see what you mean,
2327,325,do you consider yourself an introvert, yes i think i'm a very social introvert but i seem to find most social encounters to be draining where as my my boyfriend for example he um derives a lot of pleasure and energy from being around people for me it's always a little bit the opposite i have to recharge 
2328,325,mhm,
2329,325,how would your best friend describe you, i not sure i have a best friend but um i guess i'll say my boyfriend he's he's kinda my default best friend um he would probably say passionate intelligent um he always tells me that i'm really hard on myself which is true um dedicated loyal  
2330,325,that's great,
2331,325,what are you most proud of in your life, i think i'm just proud of who i am xxx i don't know if that's the answer that most people give but i think that i'm i'm really proud of who i am i try really hard um i've done a lot of things in my life i'm a really good person i think it's it's kind of rare to find people that are kind and i consider myself  a kind person that that cares about others and wants to make the world a better place so i'm i'm proud of that
2332,325,that's so good to hear, <laughter>
2333,325,have you ever served in the military, no i have not
2334,325,have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d, no
2335,325,have you been diagnosed with depression, yes
2336,325,how long ago were you diagnosed, i was probably about fifteen at the time so i think eight was is that seventeen years ago 
2337,325,you were very young weren't you, yes
2338,325,what got you to seek help, um i was cutting and my one of my best friends called um called my parents and let them know and at that point they took me in for treatment i that wasn't the first time i had ever been to a therapist or a psychiatrist but um before it was more they thought i had a_d_h_d so um it was more <m> i think my parents really took me in rather than me seeking help
2339,325,do you still go to therapy now, i haven't for about three years uh i stopped because it felt like uh i was checking in with a parole officer i just wasn't enjoying the relationship i had but i still have the psychiatrist that i go to for med checks 
2340,325,that sucks, <laughter>
2341,325,do you feel like therapy's useful, uh i do think it's useful if you have the right therapist i think if you don't have a good relationship with your therapist it can be incredibly harmful i have talked to people that have had bad experiences and and won't ever go back
2342,325,yeah,
2343,325,how have you been feeling lately, lately i've been a little bit down um i should say a little bit more down than usual because i graduated and my routine of go to school and do school things twenty four seven has come to an end and without the routine it's been a little bit  weird finding out what to do with my finding a way to be productive and knowing what to do with my time it's also been a little bit um depressing finding out that my intelligence and good grades in school doesn't translate to real world skills and there aren't that many jobs for marine biologists in california 
2344,325,yeah that sounds really hard,
2345,325,how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep, almost impossible ever since i was a little kid i had a i had trouble falling asleep and um about four years ago it it became really really bad where i just couldn't sleep through the night i was getting about four hours of sleep  sometimes i would wake up every hour and i'd wake up in the morning just a complete wreck so for about four years i've been taking trazadone so i can sleep
2346,325,okay,
2347,325,what are you like when you don't sleep well, um have you ever seen fight club um you're a virtual human so you probably haven't seen that but it's it's pretty much like that i i'm just um a complete panicked anxious wreck i i lose my ability to deal with um i lose my ability to deal with things i'm much more likely to lose my temper um i can't regulate my moods i'm just really volatile
2348,325,i see,

2586,328,awesome,
2587,328,what's your dream job , oh my dream job is to be a filmmaker that's what i wanna do i wanna die doing that job making movies 
2588,328,how did you decide to do that , well when i was uh in high school i did a lot of drama theater productions and i just love everything about film so once i had the opportunity to actually make a film uh because i wasn't getting any work as an actor i just got hooked i just love making film
2589,328,that's great , <laughter> 
2590,328,when was the last time that happened , last time i made a film just this last october made a short film 
2591,328,what was it about, <laughter> it's about three people that connect together they're completely unrelated but they get to a retreat where they realize that their problems are bigger than what they imagined originally
2592,328,mhm,
2593,328,that sounds interesting , thanks <laughter> 
2594,328,what are some things that make you really mad , really mad uh  <laughter> really mad i you know i guess what makes me really mad is when my daughter acts stupid at school when she does not do her work and uh when she doesn't pay attention and i have to get phone calls home and letters home and emergency parent conferences that's what makes me mad 
2595,328,uh oh , yeah 
2596,328,that sucks , <laughter> yeah yeah it sucks she's one of the smartest kids in her school 
2597,328,do you find it easy to be a parent , no it's it's it's very difficult because a lot of things in yourself that you find are negative go to them and it's like you're fighting against yourself trying to change yourself but you know that little person is you you know times a hundred and it's just difficult to deal with that but um other than that it it's okay but it's being a parent is never easy  
2598,328,yeah ,
2599,328,what's the hardest thing about being a parent , <sigh>  the hardest thing about being a parent  i would say is trying to give that little person so much life experience so that they don't make mistakes or so that they don't get hurt and you wanna give it to them and you want them to just accept it right away but then they don't so it gets very uh  um annoying sometimes that you know what's coming and you give them the info and they don't wanna take it they wanna find their own way and to watch them get hurt it's it's sad and then they wanna come to you and you're like ugh i tried to tell you but you can't be mad at them because everybody learns their own way so   
2600,328,uh huh,
2601,328,that sounds really hard , mm yeah i guess for a while when when you think about it uh when you watch them go through their struggles it's hard to watch but it's a necessary motion of life children have to learn the way they wanna learn 'cause once they get it they got it so however they get it you as a parent you're happy they got it 
2602,328,that's good,
2603,328,what's the best thing about being a parent , <sigh> all the love the children bestow upon you it's great they 
2604,328,aw, yeah they love <lo> you know love you and all especially my daughter she always wants to give me hugs she always wants to talk to me she always wants to be around me uh she always tells me i'm doing a great job when i'm like <laughter> what does she know about a great job she's only seven but
2605,328,<laughter> , you know they have that unconditional love and you just can't help but feel like a good person for having the children tell you that you're a good person so i like that 
2606,328,yeah,
2607,328,that's so good to hear , hmm
2608,328,what do you think of today's kids , oh <laughter> my god they're ooh <sigh> they're you know it like albert einstein said it best that our technology has exceeded our humanity and there's so much technology out there kids are learning so fast it's almost like they're already little adults but they're missing the steps to being a child they miss going outside they miss learning about things naturally rather than just going to youtube or you know wherever facebook and and getting it so fast and they don't know what to do with all this information and they just have to fight through all that info and they the it's not organic anymore children growing up these days it's not organic it's sped up it's pushed

2884,331,what are you most proud of in your life , um <psh psh> what am i most proud of  being always able to get through the things i need to get through to get to where i wanna be
2885,331,that's great ,
2886,331,what would you say are some of your best qualities , i'm generous i'm loyal uh i'm friendly i'm accommodating and um  that's about it 
2887,331,okay ,
2888,331,have you ever served in the military , no
2889,331,have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d, yes 
2890,331,how long ago were you diagnosed , uh about four years ago 
2891,331,what got you to seek help , um i well i had <ha> i was beaten up and i had uh identity theft and uh you know i was just afraid to go out so i needed to get over that so after spending one year in in my home without leaving um and just depressed all the time i i said i have to get out and start talking to people and so i did   
2892,331,yeah i'm sorry to hear that , thank you 
2893,331,how have you been feeling lately , um okay i'm panicky about the job situation  um you know 'cause my bills are pretty high and i don't really have a steady income right now 
2894,331,uh huh, so uh that's what's worrying me the most is my uh financial situation 
2895,331,that sounds really hard , yeah 
2896,331,have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately , um  yeah i mean  well basically it's like um i just recently quit drinking all together so i don't drink anymore so i'm noticing 
2897,331,that's great , yeah i mean it's good 'cause of number one i don't have the money and number two i don't like the way i act when i drink  
2898,331,mhm, um so so that's a positive thing but well the when i was drinking it helped me just forget and numb myself now i have to feel through the feelings which is pretty good 'cause i can talk my way through them so i guess i'm evolving 
2899,331,that's good ,
2900,331,have you been diagnosed with depression , uh yeah a long time ago um you know i've taken many medications here and there and um they really some of 'em would numb me some of them would  make me feel hyper so i've recently decided to <t> in the last six months three to six months just to not take anything so i don't take anything i barely even take an aspirin  just to get my body to a to get my body to a normal state  
2901,331,how hard is that,
2902,331,yeah,
2903,331,did you think you had a problem before you found out , um not really 
2904,331,what were your symptoms , always worrying just a lot of worrying always worrying worrying worrying about everything oh what happens if i get in car accident what happens if i can't pay my mortgage what happens if i eh eh just so many things i worry about and that's what was making me depressed
2905,331,yeah ,
2906,331,do you feel like therapy's useful , i do at some point i've had some good therapists and i've had some bad therapists  um i tend to like the ones that talk back to me and kinda give me some guidance as opposed to the ones that just listen  
2907,331,mhm, and then they just say okay your time's up so and just prescribe me medication so i think i'd be better with a psychiatrist <psychia> psychologist as opposed to a psychiatrist
2908,331,yeah i see what you mean ,
2909,331,what sort of changes have you noticed since you've been going to therapy, um well i'm not going to therapy now but  the therapy that i had before um  was more like people trying to uh just come in and check in and give me medication um i have had other therapy where i was back and forth like okay well this is what i think about this and you think about this and that kind of therapy is better 
2910,331,mm,
2911,331,why did you stop , um i just i wasn't getting the right therapists recently so um and i knew the the root of my problem was the drinking 'cause it's a depressant so 
2912,331,mhm, mm you know stopping the drinking is definitely made me have a much clearer mind and just to work through things myself you know 
2913,331,yeah ,
2914,331,okay ,
2915,331,tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed , um  i can't really think of anything right now 
2916,331,okay ,
2917,331,when was the last time you felt really happy , um  it's been a long time i can't really think about a time when i felt really happy 
2918,331,i'm sorry to hear that , thank you <sniffle>
2919,331,what's one of your most memorable experiences , um  okay when i was a kid um  i had a a little dog and this big dog came and and attacked it and killed it  so then a little while later my father  came and he says to my brother and me we were kids go to the car there's two packages in the car so go get them  so i was like yeah yeah yeah yeah 'cause i never listened to my parents so i was just like a spoiled brat but finally he said go to the car what's that  
2920,331,<laughter>,
2921,331,<laughter> , oh okay he said go to the car and get this out of the car so i finally went and when i opened the door there was a new dog and a bag of dog food so that's one of my memorable esperiences  
2922,331,wow,
2923,331,that's great , yeah 'cause i'm an animal lover so 
2924,331,yeah ,
2925,331,is there anything you regret , um just the way that i've treated people before when i was hurting i was really mean or rude to people when i felt like you know i was hurting i had to hurt everybody around me so um but when <wh> ever since i stopped the drinking i don't do that anymore so 
2926,331,mhm, so i think the problem is is the drinking and so now that i've let that go uh 'cause i was doing it for the wrong reasons you know i was doing it to not not feel i wasn't doing it to be sociable 
2927,331,that's good,
2928,331,yeah ,
2929,331,what advice would you give yourself ten or twenty years ago , get in a career that is really stable  like uh eh you know like a a doctor or a nurse or an attorney something that you know or in advertising i should've gone into that a sales position is it could be very well and very good or very bad so you always have to be on it in sales you can make a ton of money in sales but when you make your money save your money don't go spend it on extravagant things 
2930,331,yeah,
2931,331,that makes sense ,
2932,331,what are some things that usually put you in a good mood , um when i have a job when i when i'm able to work  uh when i'm helping other people  uh when other people around me are happy and laughing when i can make people laugh that that puts me in a good mood

3369,336,okay,
3370,336,do you consider yourself an introvert, i am both
3371,336,why, well i'm introverted because i like to spend time by myself and i'm extroverted 'cause i like to meet new people uh used to be totally an introvert

3376,336,how hard is that, um well i wrote the first twenty pages pretty quick so um uh now i'm expanding it
3377,336,what made you decide to do that, i get inspiration uh it was actually a dream and then i wrote down the dream and now it's becoming uh i could probably turn it into a movie
3378,336,that sounds like a great situation, <laughter> yeah
3379,336,what are some things that make you really mad, uh when people don't respect me that's the number one
3380,336,mm,
3381,336,do you feel that way often, no i just that my brothers they don't respect me they don't really um you know i want to love my family and but i don't want to hang around my brothers so it's a conflict
3382,336,that sucks, exactly
3383,336,how are you at controlling your temper, pretty good i only get mad about once a year
3384,336,when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about, um my girlfriend about two or three months ago she was wanting me to do something and i said no <yawn> and i don't know yeah

3390,336,okay,
3391,336,what do you do now, um well i'm looking into ways to expand my consciousness so that i can have more money and more abundance in my life so i can uh have my own house and uh live in my own creative space 
3392,336,what's your dream job, <sniffle> uh singing i'm a singer so let's see like unforgettable so uh that's what i like to do

3395,336,have you ever served in the military, no
3396,336,have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d, no
3397,336,have you been diagnosed with depression, no
3398,336,how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep, oh that's the hard part i uh i don't 
3399,336,why, i don't know maybe it's because when i was uh a kid my brothers beat me up and i don't feel totally rested in myself or in my life so uh i feel like uh <sniffle> i don't feel totally safe
3400,336,i'm sorry, yeah
3401,336,what are you like when you don't sleep well, um a little irritable but i have been sleeping better since i met my girlfriend so it's not totally bad
3402,336,that's good,
3403,336,have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately, my what
3404,336,have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately, behavior what
3405,336,how have you been feeling lately, i don't know um well i feel more positive i did the seminar and uh so that let me get rid of some crap in my brain <sniffle> and be more positive about life
3406,336,uh huh,
3407,336,tell me about that, um well did a lot of exercises to uh reduce my stress and lot of my stress comes from uh judging myself and other people 
3408,336,do you think that maybe you're being a little hard on yourself, yeah you could say that <laughter>
3409,336,how hard is that, uh well <sniffle> mm mm i don't know it's hard <yawn> hard to deal with sometimes i mean sometimes a lot much too critical for my own good
3410,336,how do you cope with them, uh <sniffle>  well watching t_v gets up but <yawn> uh lately i just been feeling like i need to um have less judgement and more fun 
3411,336,that's good,
3412,336,what made you decide to do that, uh well i did that seminar
3413,336,okay,
3414,336,when was the last time you felt really happy, um it was about a week ago i think 
3415,336,tell me more about that, uh well i went to that seminar i got there i was able to take off work and <yawn> <sniffle> be in a different environment 'cause my job is stressful and <sniffle> my life is stressful so uh <sniffle> i was able to take a break which is great
3416,336,that's good,
3417,336,how would your best friend describe you, uh i'd say i'm outgoing fun smart uh but i mean in l_a people in l_a they don't want to most of them don't want to spend time with you
3418,336,uh huh, i don't know if that's because of me or l_a
3419,336,i see what you mean,
3420,336,that makes sense, <laughter>
3421,336,is there anything you regret, uh that i spend a lot of my time worrying and criticizing myself instead of moving forward
3422,336,could you have done anything to avoid it, avoid it yeah watching t_v or going to see movies or <sniffle> trying not to think of it but it doesn't solve the problem
3423,336,has that gotten you in trouble, uh well a little bit i haven't paid my bills a lot i still owe money <sniffle> so um it's kind of a self-defeating prophecy <proph> prophecy 
3424,336,what advice would you give yourself ten or twenty years ago, uh stop criticizing and start creating your future now instead of waiting for it to happen 
3425,336,mm,
3426,336,who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life, uh my girlfriend's been really helpful
3427,336,tell me more about that, <yawn> well she's funny and <sniffle> she loves me and cares about <abo> about me and 
3428,336,that's so good to hear, uh <laughter> yeah
3429,336,what would you say are some of your best qualities, um singer and i'm intelligent and creative and multi-dimensional and uh i'm a good listener 
3430,336,uh huh,
3431,336,what are you most proud of in your life, uh well i've written about four or five books i uh my voice i think would be number one 'cause when i started i didn't have much of a singing voice but now i do
3432,336,that's good,
3433,336,okay i think i've asked everything i need to,
3434,336,thanks for sharing your thoughts with me, okay bye
3435,336,goodbye,
3436,337,hi i'm ellie thanks for coming in today,
3437,337,i was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment,
3438,337,i'm not a therapist but i'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you i'll ask a few questions to get us started,
3439,337,and please feel free to tell me anything your answers are totally confidential,

3441,337,okay,
3442,337,so how are you doing today, i'm doing okay how are you doing
3443,337,that's good,
3444,337,i'm great thanks,
3445,337,where are you from originally, i'm originally from like a suburb <su> a suburb of l_a from the san gabriel valley
3446,337,really,
3447,337,what are some things you really like about l_a, i like the diversity i like the vibe of the city i've lived other places and it's just not as happy here i feel like i can really thrive here so i just like l_a
3448,337,mhm, like all the things that are so close together then there's a lot of interesting things that totally different parts of the city just miles away from each other
3449,337,yeah,
3450,337,i see what you mean,
3451,337,what are some things you don't really like about l_a, uh don't like the traffic don't like all the cars but i can live with it i mean there's not that much i don't like
3452,337,okay,
3453,337,what'd you study at school, i studied music um vocal performance i studied music technology things like that
3454,337,awesome,
3455,337,are you still working in that, yes
3456,337,what do you do now, right now um i sing in an opera company but my i do have a day job because it doesn't pay that much unless you're actually working for the l_a opera so i do have a day job i work at a call center that caters mostly to performers and actors and things like that and it's really good because if i get a call i can call in and change my shift very easily so it's actually a pretty good gig
3457,337,okay, and i do some uh technology gigs sometimes you know it's do some recording some live sound stuff but i'm kinda wanna get away from that do some video work sometimes but again i wanna get away from that i wanna go back to the 
3458,337,why, because i find that performing more is more interesting i like being talent more than i like being crew <laughter> so i kinda wanna get away from that side and start working more toward actually doing what i wanna do with my life
3459,337,okay,
3460,337,do you consider yourself an introvert, sometimes i mean per my personal life yeah so i do have a shell that i put out there to deal with people but if i'm at home you know i'd kinda rather just keep to myself or my husband or my cats or whatever talk to family   don't really have too many close friends <clears throat> but yeah you know i'd rather keep to myself
3461,337,uh huh,
3462,337,how close are you to your family, uh moderately close to the family that i have left i've actually lost a lot of family in the last ten years or so
3463,337,i'm sorry to hear that, but like thank you <laughter> but like uh my i'm close to my husband and you know i've got couple of cousins i talk to and my aunt that i have an aunt that i talk to a bit but it's not like we're interacting every day close together 
3464,337,right, but it's somewhat close
3465,337,okay,
3466,337,what do you do to relax, mostly i sing or i read or i write or just hang out and try to clear my mind of all thoughts sometimes it doesn't work but i try to do that and try to just clear everything and see what starts coming back in and sometimes <ss> sometimes that works sometimes it doesn't but mostly creating things um contacting my family some <so> you know through facebook or whatever
3467,337,uh huh, works but mostly in my free time i create things
3468,337,okay,
3469,337,do you travel a lot, i'd like to travel more i like to travel by car a lot um i mean my idea of like having a birthday celebration would be to go on a road trip and i like to travel more um i would love to travel for work things or whatever but i don't get as much of an opportunity as i would like to to travel
3470,337,what do you enjoy about traveling, seeing <see> uh particularly traveling by car seeing like the landscape change seeing people change seeing you know feeling the vibrations of the area change  i like just seeing what's out there seeing and i know that there's a bigger world outside of  where i am and where i live and my world and i like to see that
3471,337,uh huh, but i like to leave that too and go back to my own world <laughter>
3472,337,<laughter>, <laughter> <clears throat>
3473,337,i'd love to hear about one of your trips, um let's see xxx a trip that i like to take is to make the drive from here to nevada whether i go all the way to vegas or just go to state line um my cousin and i would take what we call exit one trips because once you get to the first exit of a highway you're either in another state or you're at the end of the highway so we'd take those we'd just   sort of impromptu with like <li> a day or two notice just move things around just take off so those are actually trips that i i like making <mak> 'cause i take off and then just come back sometimes the same day sometimes overnight just small short trips that aren't very involved but you just get to go and you see things and see how um you know the desert landscape looks in different seasons how people react in different times of the year in different areas 
3474,337,uh huh, so close to home but not but not close to home close to home but uh still a world away so that 'cause i don't really have time to take like a two week vacation or whatever but that's just little things that kinda put things back in perspective and and clear my head and things like that i mean 'cause there's sort of a sense of meditation and zen that you get on a highway that you don't get driving a freeway
3475,337,yeah, so i i like i like doing that
3476,337,i see what you mean,
3477,337,cool,
3478,337,when was the last time that happened, the last time that happened was may of last year that's the last time i was able to do that we actually my aunt came over with my cousin who's ten years younger than i am and we kinda grew up like sisters and i was about to move away from the inland empire which is where they live so they kinda took me on a last hurrah and we drove up to vegas and looked around and came back 'cause i actually lived in vegas for awhile but i didn't like it so they kinda i showed <show> showed them some of the locals sites around there and we came back and was you know an overnight trip but we were driving the entire time <laughter> so
3479,337,wow, it was kind of an interesting
3480,337,what are some things that make you really mad, uh things that are just inherently unfair when people are mean to the elderly or to children or to animals people who can't fight back and they're mean to them just because they can't fight back   and i actually like to see people who are strong <st> as strong as the people who are being mean standing up and being an advocate
3481,337,yeah, or what have you so i think that's one thing that's makes me really mad just being cruel or mean for no reason you know not people <pe> for people who can't fight back or for people who've done nothing to deserve it just that kinda really just makes me mad
3482,337,uh huh,
3483,337,okay,
3484,337,what do you do when you're annoyed, when i'm annoyed i'll try to just walk away from the situation and if the situation insists on following me then i'll wind up lashing out somehow either   you know verbally just cutting 'em with a quip or you know i mean i i rarely just i rarely will yell at somebody but i'll try to you know if i'll try to walk away and defuse it if that doesn't work then i'll let them know that they're annoying me and get away from me <laughter> that usually works 
3485,337,has that gotten you in trouble, not in like legal trouble or anything because usually i'll find a way to get them to leave me alone um so there's not really like big trouble but 'cause i think 'cause it's it it is off-putting and it's not expected <exp> the expected reaction and that's actually kind of cultivated in me that it's not the expected reaction 'cause i know that will work and get people away from me so it's not really in trouble and if 
3486,337,uh huh, it's is trouble it's usually trouble that it's from their the other person's perspective and it doesn't affect me at all because it's usually a situation i can get out of  so as long as they leave me alone you know i don't i i'll walk away from it
3487,337,okay,
3488,337,when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about, uh the last time i argued with somebody like person <per> like a person <per> like a family member or an outsider or somebody not in my
3489,337,whatever comes to your mind, uh the last thing i can think of was i argued with my husband about the care of my mother-in-law 'cause she's got dementia and so we one of the reasons we came out here from the inland empire was to take care of her 'cause she won't go anywhere but l_a i mean she is like hardcore angelino like you know we we know we are the we're that in our nature but we also know it's cheaper to live elsewhere <laughter> but um so we came out here to take care of her 
3490,337,yeah, and he wants her to be able to stay in her in her apartment and i want her to move in with us because it would be cheaper and faster and easier and safer for her if she lived with us but she wants to stay where she is 'cause she can't see that there's inherent danger now because of the disease process 
3491,337,yeah, but he wants her to stay where she he wants her to be able to have what she wants 'cause he's a mama's boy like i am i'm a mama's girl even though i've lost my mom like four years ago i'm still a mama's girl and i'll still <st> and i still and i know that it brings you a sense of satisfaction to to carry out their wishes because you care about them so much and that's what they want so you wanna get it for 'em and because you know they you know that happened when you were growing up when they tried to give you what you want because you wanted it  and you wanna do that for them now like sort of giving back to them somebody that you care about somebody you feel deserves it but it's kinda dangerous for her you know and i don't want things <thi> something to happen to her yet i want her to remain who she is for as long as she can 'cause i know it the disease that she has is gonna erase who she is eventually
3492,337,yeah, and eventually she will have to be put in a place where they can give her twenty four hour medically trained care but until then we can we can handle it you know amongst ourselves 'cause it's not that bad but it's getting where she really shouldn't <shou> has no business living by herself anymore so the solution right now is he stays there most the time with her and i go back to our house and i it gets stressful and it gets annoying because i do i handle the outside things i run the errands i take her to the store things like that he does the day to day things makes sure she has <ha> she eats makes sure she you know has clean clothes things like that
3493,337,uh huh, so i mean it's a partnership it's a it's a dual effort it's very much a dual effort but i would like her to move in with us so that was that's like a source of it's not really like yelling screaming argument but lively discussion <laughter> you know than debate
3494,337,i see,
3495,337,that sounds really hard, meh it's not insurmountable i mean life's not gonna be easy ever and if it is that's when you should worry because that's when somebody can pull the rug out from under you so as long as you're on top of things and you're present in your life it's not gonna be easy but you deal with it and you you move on
3496,337,yeah,
3497,337,who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life, uh the most positive influence i think have been probably my mother and my grandmother 'cause my mom was pretty much a single mom and my grandmother helped raise me and they actually gave me a lot of confidence and but were realistic about it so i mean i think i have sort of a realistic sort of a downer temperment <laughter> to myself but they but they helped me see that it's just in me and it's not something i can't get over
3498,337,uh huh, and that you know life's gonna go on you know my mom would say to me when you're forty you're forty whether you're working at mcdonald's or doing what you want with your life and i think that was a big influence on how i lived have how i've lived my life since she's passed  
3499,337,that's great,
3500,337,is there anything you regret, i regret not taking care of myself in the last year of my mother's life because i think it may have clouded some of my decisions now i do have underlying conditions and everybody in my family is diabetic and i didn't take care of that when she was the last year of her life 'cause i was too busy wanting to get her home my focus was to get her home
3501,337,yeah, so i didn't eat right i didn't take my insulin right um i wound up making myself insulin resistant that that year just 'cause my blood sugar was so high for eh like a year eating just horrible foods when i did eat so it really took a toll and i really actually made myself very sick  and i'm wondering well if i didn't if i would've taken care of myself and i had my head on completely straight and my my vision <vi> my vision and my thoughts weren't completely <complete> weren't clouded would i have made some better decisions on her behalf especially when she needed 'em and when she needed me to be to step in and make the decisions for her because she  uh wound up having a health catastrophe 'cause she had kidney well she had kidney damage that wound up being kidney failure and her health insurance provider missed that so she wound up having
3502,337,wow, sort of this whole catastrophe where everything at once just started breaking down she wound up having a stroke at like fifty one she had had a small stroke and it just kinda went down from there so i'm thinking well if i didn't if i had taken care of better care of myself would i have been able to take better care of her and i know there wasn't anything i would've been able to do to prevent her death but what if i if i would i have been be able to make it easier on her if i would have taken care of myself and that's like one huge regret that i have
3503,337,yeah,
3504,337,do you think that maybe you're being a little hard on yourself, oh i know i am <laughter> but xxx it's my desire to take responsibility for everyone and everything that i care about taking responsibility for my own life and me and mine and i know other people i can't really direct them into my own vision because they're their own individual beings and they can't you know be what i want them to be and i know they're not going to be but i still have you know my ideals and i want the way i want everything to go and i want everybody that i care about to be happy and to be able too  fit into my life in a way in the best way possible but i know 'cause they're other beings and i know i'm not gonna be able to do that for them and they're not gonna be able to do that for me but it's still my ideals <laughter> so i have to sometimes have to look at it and go well
3505,337,mhm, is this what i want because i want it or what is what they want and what's their <thei> is it their decision or mine and it's usually it's theirs and i know it's theirs so i so if you really care about somebody you're just gonna support them and go with them but 
3506,337,yeah, it's still kinda hard <laughter> for for me and know i gotta get over it
3507,337,yeah,
3508,337,what advice would you give yourself ten or twenty years ago, um ten or twenty years ago probably to have been more assertive in starting my own life because i wound taking care of my mother i mean she got sick literally the weekend i graduated from college <laughter> and i had a job lined up and i had to pull out of that because she needed me to take care of her and i think i would've been more aggressive about starting my own life getting a job outside  the house in addition to caring for her getting uh my own job history my own credit history thing like things like that built up instead of becoming just totally her daughter for about ten years
3509,337,uh huh, so i think i i probably would've done that um but i tell myself just do that you keep who you are and learn to separate your you who you are and what you feel you need to be doing for your family to keep a sense of of yourself that's probably what i would've and do things for yourself to keep that sense of yourself that's probably the advance advice of what i would give myself   
3510,337,mhm, ten years ago <laughter>
3511,337,okay,
3512,337,have you ever served in the military, no
3513,337,have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d, no
3514,337,have you been diagnosed with depression, no but probably 'cause i haven't gone to a doctor about it <laughter> 'cause i don't wanna know and i mean it's not i know there've been times in my life where i've been severely depressed and it's usually circumstances and had to pull myself out of it but i'd rather pull myself out of it before resorting to treatment and of it gets <ge>
3515,337,can you give me an example of that, um after my mother had died i mean it'd been this long battle for a year that we lost and i didn't know if i if i was to blame for that it's like logically i knew i wasn't but how could i convince myself of that um two weeks after she died i wound up with pulmonary embolisms in one in each lung because i didn't take care of myself for a year and i figured oh i'm thirty years old if you know whatever i do to myself i can get over no <laughter> turns out no <laughter> but um i mean i wound up having to take more medication because of that uh it's been a fight to get my own health back to get to be able to get out of that depression 'cause so much of my life was based on being my mother's daughter all of a sudden i didn't it's like the rug was pulled out my like bottom fell out of my world after that so
3516,337,yeah, that was the prilly pretty much sent me into a deep depression um i almost got divorced because of it because i just didn't want anything anymore  so and i was i being really distant from my husband by then at that time we were married for about two years at that point and i started getting very distant from him just pushing everything away just you know figuring well what am i gonna do with the rest of my life now and it it's been a fight you know you mean there times when no i couldn't get up just stay in bed and sleep all day you know but then realizing that when my mother died i had four cats to look after two are mine two are hers and so i wound up adopting the two that were hers i mean well they don't have a choice of whether they can go out and get their own food and get their own you know own own supplies
3517,337,uh huh, i took that responsibility of doing it for them so that was one motivating factor was that they didn't have a choice of whether or not i was gonna get up and provide for them i mean i could go without eating i could go without taking care of myself but they couldn't
3518,337,yeah, they didn't you know so they eh they actually got me up and and made me go out and face things even though i didn't want to didn't just didn't just kinda wanted to curl up and die but that would've been my choice not theirs and they i mean what would happen to them if i wasn't there to take care of them they would've been you know sent to a shelter or whatever probably  and maybe they would've not been readopt me home and adopted by somebody else maybe they would have been killed for  for me i mean for me making selfish decisions  
3519,337,mhm, so it's like i need somebody to take care of to get myself out of bed <laughter> so <s> and that's actually been a motivating factor is to to 'cause i've figured out that if it was just me i'd be able to live without a lot of stuff i mean i would be able to live in my car if i wanted it wouldn't be a big deal i wouldn't care   as long as i was doing what i wanted with my life but i have a family to look after now  so i have to go out and do things 
3520,337,yeah, you know i i have to go out and look for legitimate work you know day you know day job i have to you know   but i'm trying to strike a balance between the two because it's what i wanna do with my life but yet i have to take care of my family so i'm   been working on on a balance of the two
3521,337,how hard is that , very <laughter> but it's worth it i mean  it would be very i'd have a lot less things to worry about if i just lived in my car and said forget it <laughter>  but keeping a residence down paying bills things like that  it's it's difficult but you have to do it you know if you want you want anything <anyth> if you ever want anything in your life you have to go through that 
3522,337,yeah, and i and and i know that  but  it it gets hard sometimes you do wanna give up  but then  it's like well what's the alternative  i mean i don't think i could live a comfortable life  'cause if i did i wouldn't do anything <laughter> i have to be slightly uncomfortable or i'm not gonna do anything with myself i'm just gonna  be content to just hang out all day stay in bed hang out with my cats or whatever  and i wouldn't get anything done 
3523,337,i see,
3524,337,how have you been feeling lately , uh very  anxious and nervous and i mean what if  i don't find  enough you know enough work to be able to pay my rent or whatever what if um  you know what what if i can't   keep a semblance of stability in my life and it it's actually hard work to be stable <laughter> and i know it's hard work to be stable but  what you know it's just eh a lot of what ifs  and and i don't think it's things that haven't happened and it's stupid and pointless to worry about things that haven't happened and i know that  but it still happens <ha> it still creeps in  so that's actually  a source of  anxiety  but then you try to let the anxiety go by getting things done figuring things out making a solid plan and going for it  but i i i know it it's a cycle
3525,337,that's good , and i'll go from being really anxious and oh my god what am i gonna do what am i gonna do to saying okay what is the fundamental thing i need to take of here  i mean what <wha> what is just extraneous and what can <c> what can what is what are the actual non issues and what is the actual issue 
3526,337,mhm, and so  figure out how to figure things out that way and then the anxiety starts to go away a little bit but then something'll pop up and the what ifs will come up again  mm i'll have to  uh  figure it out again <laughter> but i know it's a cycle i know um what seems huge on the surface when you start chipping away at it   you get over it pretty quickly you get through it 
3527,337,yes,
3528,337,when was the last time you felt really happy , the last time i felt really happy i don't know zz um i  huh <laughter> that's a good question that actually <ac> that actually surprisingly stumped me  because i do feel happy sometimes sometimes not so much sometimes just kinda eh in the middle um really like overjoyously happy i don't know  i i'm not i can't think of <o> of when that happened
3529,337,okay ,
3530,337,how would your best friend describe you , i don't know you don't know  perceptions of other people i mean  probably as somebody who  oddly enough somebody who is laid back and you know  handles things as they come but i don't see myself as that   at all and it's a it
3531,337,what would you say are some of your best qualities , probably that i can think on my feet and i'm not afraid to  hussle my butt off and do whatever i have to to survive and get things done  um that  and i can do it creatively and i try to  strive for balance  probably  probably the best things about me <laughter> 
3532,337,uh huh,
3533,337,that's great,
3534,337,what are you most proud of in your life , that i'm doing basically what i want with my life which even though it's not all easy it's not  um you know i'm not financially well off or anything it's still a lot more than a lot of people can say about their lives 'cause i have an aunt that i really don't talk to  who and the reason why i don't talk to her is because she's always miserable i mean she's got a career that she  it's more of a job that she fell into  'cause my older aunt uh loves animals but didn't wanna be a veterinarian so she became a dog groomer 
3535,337,uh huh, and she was actually really good at it she had a stable business for a long time   but her hands <ha> you know she started getting arthritis in her hands and she had um the actually my cousin's father went and kinda stole all the money from her business so she lost her business   and she kinda she retired early 'cause between that and the arthritis she wound up retiring early 
3536,337,uh oh , she employed my younger aunt who was still a dog groomer but she hates it   and it's like change your life if you hate your life so much change it 
3537,337,yeah, and the thing <thi> the thing i'm most proud of is  yeah i'm not as financially well off as she is but i'm doing what i want with my life you know i can  be creative i can have creative people around me people who i actually like to talk to around me  people i actually like in my life and  be happy with that  and i see a lot of people who aren't  and it it gives me a sense of of maybe a a bloated sense of self satisfaction to be able to say i'm not like that 
3538,337,yeah , and i'm actually doing what i want even though there's sacrifices i'm still fundamentally doing what i want with my life now
3539,337,mhm,

3676,339,how has seeing a therapist affected you  , um it's just allowed me to know that actually speaking about the issues um relieves me of the tension of um holding them inside so that's how it's helped me
3677,339,yeah how hard is that, at first it was difficult just being open with my internal emotions but now it um it actually is good because i know that when things are occurring  um if i'm able to um communicate about them with a certain individual
3678,339,mhm, it um relieves me of the stress of of uh trying to figure out everything alone and often times um by speaking about the issues it um allows me to come up with an alternative plan that may be be better just because i'm hearing myself speak of the issue

4235,346,how did you decide to do that , it was something that i fell into when i was a teenager  scrubbed_entry and uh i really enjoyed doing it and i hadn't done it for years um  so i figured why not i just came back to california and might as well try something that i did enjoy really doing  
4236,346,that sounds interesting ,
4237,346,are you happy you did that , um so far um i just got picked up by an agent  so i haven't really done anything yet as an adult  but um  i'm hoping  hoping something it'll be fruitful  
4238,346,yeah ,

4240,346,how close are you to your family , um  i'm close i mean we <w> we hang out um i i don't tell them everything  um they're kind of judgmental  but um  other than that i mean i mean we hang out i mean i see them every day 
4241,346,that's good ,
4242,346,what do you do to relax, um  geez um  it's kinda hard for me to relax um i mean i try to watch t_v um and i read  a lot um  that's probably about it i read i do a lot of sleeping <laughter> i'm a little depressed so um  yeah it's kinda it's xxx like i said it's really hard for me to relax 
4243,346,how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep , um  it isn't  um i tend to think a lot  um about the things that stress me out  um i've been through a lot of a lot of stuff so um  yeah so i i don't i don't i don't sleep very well at night and if i do fall asleep i wake up all through the night usually with some kind of anxiety attacks 
4244,346,are they triggered by something, um  i dream a lot about um the stuff that has uh  has affected me throughout the years so um  it's usually you know like i i'll dream about something that stressed me out and then i'll wake up and my my chest'll hurt    um  or just i just can't sleep all night because i just think i seem to be i don't know if i'm afraid to go to sleep  but i uh <sigh> i just i don't know i feel like that <th> that's a vulnerable place for me  because of stuff that've happened to me 
4245,346,yeah , so um  i i so i sleeping is just not really something i do well 
4246,346,okay ,
4247,346,what are you like when you don't sleep well , um  tired  i'm uh  i'm moody i'm very sensitive  um  i uh i'm just negative <ne> a negative person  um which really that's not me um  i uh yeah i'm like <l> judgmental is not me either um i just  i'm just not a not a nice person to be around 
4248,346,how do you cope with them , um  i try to <t> i i spend a lot of my time reading i try to go out and do um i force myself to go out and do things um  just to keep myself involved  um so that i don't uh sit <si> just sit around and and and dwell on the fact that i can't sleep and i i try to um get myself as exhausted as i possibly can  um by running around and and and doing things  so 
4249,346,mhm,
4250,346,how hard is that , um it's difficult  um i do like there is a part of me that doesn't wanna  i don't really wanna go out and do things i have to actually force myself to um if i have make appointments i uh  i make appointments to like for auditions or or um  even to do this i um i i tend to uh  just not  like at the last minute i'll i'll try to convince myself not to go <laughter> but then i force myself to anyways  
4251,346,yeah ,
4252,346,i see,
4253,346,have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d, yes 
4254,346,how long ago were you diagnosed , um i've been diagnosed for two instances  um i was diagnosed <dia> diagnosed about three years three and a half years ago  and then i was diagnosed again um in august
4255,346,what got you to seek help , um  the first time it was um  i just wasn't sleeping <sl> because of the not sleeping um   and the uh just the stress <st> the unbelievable stress 
4256,346,uh huh , um  and then the second time it was a xxx uh once again i started with the not sleeping um and then every moment of the day was just thinking about what happened to me um  and i just i i just couldn't take it anymore  so i i figured um  i was getting too gloomy i was getting like um  not thinking life was worth it and and i i i that's i just needed to see somebody before anything escalated 
4257,346,yeah ,
4258,346,that sounds really hard , yeah  it was 
4259,346,do you still go to therapy now, i no <n> do not
4260,346,why did you stop , um one of the reasons i went to new york was to try to um  get out of my environment  um and uh  and that seemed to help a lot  um 
4261,346,uh huh, and uh out here i i was i just the counselors that i was going to just didn't really seem to be helping me much  um they just 
4262,346,i'm sorry to hear that , they just seemed to be giving me a lot of medications and i don't believe that that's what i needed  um 
4263,346,yeah , yeah so um  yeah 
4264,346,how have you been feeling lately , <sigh> stressed um uh lately i've been really sad and i don't know why   um  but like i said i've been trying to combat that by um   keeping myself busy 
4265,346,that's good ,
4266,346,when was the last time you felt really happy , um  actually um  i'm kind of a couple days ago  i was actually really happy and i was genuinely happy   um but then i went back to  being you know going back to feeling miserable  so
4267,346,can you tell me about that , um  well i realized  i got up in the morning i actually did get a good night of sleep  and um  i realized uh that i'm actually really lucky  um 'cause i've been through a lot in my life and i have um somebody in my life who really loves me and somebody who um is finally there for me  and uh  you know he gives me what i need emotionally and i was just really thankful for that  and that made me really happy  um 
4268,346,that's so good to hear , yeah  thank you <laughter>
4269,346,what are you most proud of in your life , oh geez um  i've had so many years of just  just bad just a lot of bad  that it there has it's been a long time  since i've been proud of anything  i guess if anything it's my ability to survive through all the hardships i've been through 
4270,346,mhm, um my <m> a lesser person i guess would've  gotten rid of themselves a long time ago  but um even though like i'm really depressed and i feel gloomy and i feel <fe> just feel miserable about a lot of things um  there's gotta be a silver lining  so 
4271,346,yeah , um so yeah so i mean like i guess that's what i'm proud of that uh  i although a whole bunch of bad things have happened to me it hasn't ruined me i still try to be a good person um i i try not to be negative towards other people  and um  and truthful and i still i still have drive in me 
4272,346,that's great, yeah 
4273,346,is there anything you regret, ugh <sigh> so much um  my last marriage um not getting out when i should have  um  and uh just i regret a lot
4274,346,what advice would you give yourself ten or twenty years ago , <sigh> um the any situation that would've had a red flag um  eh just get out of it you know eh some things just don't work and um  no matter how hard you try no matter how much you put into it so um  i i would tell myself um to um  that it's not selfish  to let go of a bad situation  and um not everybody can be helped so sometimes you just gotta live for yourself and help yourself 
4275,346,yeah , so if
4276,346,mhm, had i known that then had had i known that then i i i probably would've done better in life so 
4277,346,i see what you mean , yeah 
4278,346,what are some things that make you really mad , <sigh> um people who um  when people are down on me for my faults  um that i have done that i have things that i've done in my past that people steal still relive when i'm trying to forgive myself um  people who are mean to other people uh people who talk poorly about people behind their backs people that are untrustworthy um just anybody who picks on the little guy  um  you know people who don't care about the environment or animals um 
4279,346,mhm, i just <jus> i think that everybody should be as good as they possibly can be  and uh it's it's disheartening and it it just makes me so mad that people just can't be people don't let people live people try to make um everybody feel as negative and as poorly as they do  and uh i that makes me mad 
4280,346,yeah ,
4281,346,okay ,
4282,346,what do you do when you're annoyed , <laughter> i vent <laughter> um  yeah i tend to vent and then uh  and them um and then it's usually over i try not to bad mouth people um i try to just talk through it until um until it's gone and then it doesn't bother me anymore
4283,346,that's good ,
4284,346,how are you at controlling your temper, mm i try not to get angry um  because i have a really bad temper and it um  and it can get outta hand so um  what i do is i i <laughter> something gets me so mad i tend to go and take a nap  um <laughter> if i'm not in that situation where i can just go and take a nap um i usually just walk away from the situation and i try to clear my mind and come back to it 
4285,346,okay ,
4286,346,when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about , um  it was a couple days ago it was actually with my mother um  it was about um  actually she thought that i had taken a shirt from her  and um she was screaming and yelling at me and um  i was i was tired um i was it was late and um  i started to yell at <a> back at her you know because i was hurt that she would accuse me of something so petty um  and you <yo> <sigh> it's uh going back to my past you know when i was younger and you know i didn't care about you know people's things and i would just kinda take and do whatever i wanted to and i'm not i'm so far from that person   um and i it it hurt me so i got mad and i and i started to yell and argue  mm kinda petty and stupid but  at the time it it seemed  it seemed uh  viable

4634,350,how have you been feeling lately , i've been feeling okay um there are days yeah um i don't know every day is different so i mean today i feel fine but like i said everything is differently lately i've been feeling um more like i can be involved <inv> involved in my own life and like i wanna get   out and do more things 
4635,350,yeah ,
4636,350,have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately , um  no no it's no no i haven't  not any different from before what i was experiencing before 
4637,350,do you still go to therapy now , no 
4638,350,why did you stop , mm well mm i was receiving um  uh i guess psychotherapy and um i don't know a lot of things happened i moved for a while to go take care of my grandmother and i just kinda  got more involved in taking care of other people instead of myself for a while 
4639,350,that sounds really hard , uh sometimes 
4640,350,do you feel like therapy's useful , i do  yes it is
4641,350,how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep , it's kinda difficult um i either have a hard time falling asleep or a hard time staying asleep
4642,350,are they triggered by something , i'm sure it is i just don't know what it is as of yet because i you know <sniffle> usually it's um thoughts continual thoughts running through my mind that either keep me up or make it hard for me to uh go asleep or make it hard for me to stay asleep
4643,350,mhm, mhm
4644,350,how do you cope with them , um journal sometimes uh that might help if i can write some things down and get it out that helps other than that i don't you know i haven't found any really great ways of coping 
4645,350,i see , it
4646,350,what are you like when you don't sleep well , tired <laughter>  yeah mostly uh tired um kinda confused 
4647,350,okay ,
4648,350,when was the last time you felt really happy , i don't know for the most part i feel happy it's just um   last time i felt really happy was i guess over the holidays 
4649,350,i'd love to hear all about it , uh i don't know i guess the just being around uh family and friends just the holiday season i guess in general that's just a happy time for me and seeing people i haven't seen in a while um that's about it 
4650,350,okay ,
4651,350,how would your best friend describe you , how would my best friend describe me probably as um  quiet sometimes cautious talkative sometimes um tenacious  um i don't know a lot of my friends say that they look up to me for uh some of my accomplishments and they also say that they are grateful to have me as a friend because i'm caring and compassionate or um easy to talk to um that i remind them of a of <o> feel like a sister to them 
4652,350,aw ,
4653,350,that's great , <laughter> 
4654,350,is there anything you regret, um everyone has regrets i'm sure yeah i regret stuff 
4655,350,what advice would you give yourself ten or twenty years ago , to just  relax and be yourself and just go ahead and it sounds cliche and i don't mean to sound that way but it's true it's just um you have to learn how to be comfortable with you and relax and just know you um to not compare yourself to other people because what someone else is doing or where they may be in their life at a certain time is not necessarily where you are supposed to be or what you're supposed to be doing at that time it doesn't mean that you're less competent or less able to do it it just means that everyone has their path and everyone has their  their time and their progression to how they get to things so i would tell me ten years ago to just believe in me and stay on my own path for what it is that i want for my life and don't be 
4656,350,yeah , yeah 
4657,350,that makes sense ,
4658,350,tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed , um really enjoyed working with um well  okay a science project <laughter> with um my younger uh relatives my cousins we did a science project together and it was fun despite the mess we made it was a ball
4659,350,awesome ,
4660,350,what are you most proud of in your life , um being the first to attend college in my family and then um going to college and coming back to the community where i uh went to school and then teaching in that community and volunteering in that community and helping um youth or children that come from the same background that i came from so  uh i'm most proud of being able to  have the opportunity to improve and better myself and then to come back and help someone else improve and better themself as well  
4661,350,that sounds like a great situation ,

4702,351,okay,
4703,351,what do you do when you're annoyed, um i kind of am quiet about it and when a person pushes me to a certain point that's when i overreact usually
4704,351,how hard is that, um it's pretty hard um i rather the person notice that i'm kinda getting withdrawn and actively engage in me instead of getting it to the point where it's like um it it comes to a point where it blows out of proportion 
4705,351,yeah i understand,
4706,351,what's one of your most memorable experiences, um um probably spending time with my family in new york

4718,351,what got you to seek help, um i'm just uh during that time i was just going through a lot of issues and i was feeling unsafe to myself so i ended up going um to the doctor to kinda get meds and have therapy and stuff
4719,351,do you still go to therapy now, um not currently i i did about like six months ago
4720,351,why did you stop, um i just felt the therapist wasn't really helping me um i felt we kept on talking about the same things over and over and xxx she wasn't really challenging me and i've been in therapy for a really long time so i just knew it was a change
4721,351,yeah i'm sorry to hear that, it's okay <laughter>
4722,351,do you feel like therapy is useful, um yes i do actually um  when i feel connected to a therapist um and when i feel like it's a really great way for me to talk about what i'm going through um so yes i do
4723,351,what sort of changes have you noticed since you've been going to therapy, um i'm better at describing my emotions and feelings i think the biggest thing is um when i'm in situations eh i can see myself reacting one way and i take a step back and see how i can react normally almost in a way um    also i tend to take a lot of my emotions and feelings and kind of bury them and make them feel like really bad about myself so it's nice to talk to someone that's not judging that doesn't really tell me like you know um they tell me it's o okay basically <clears throat>
4724,351,that's good,
4725,351,what were your symptoms, um feeling hopeless all the time not having you know enough energy to do things i used to like i had a little bit of concentration issues  um having weird disturbing thoughts sometimes just pop into my mind and just overall just feeling kinda crummy about life 
4726,351,are they triggered by something, um sometimes they are at  like random moments that if there's like a problem with like my interpersonal life or something like that or if i sometimes even seeing something on television um like sometimes that affects me 
4727,351,how do you cope with them, um listening to music or trying to distract myself um trying like my therapist told me for the longest time to journal to record things
4728,351,mhm, <clears throat> 
4729,351,how have you been feeling lately, um it's been a tough transition to come here so uh well being <be> being here um so um kinda half and half okay and not okay <laguhter>

4731,351,okay,
4732,351,how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep, um <clears throat> some days it's great some days it's not um more recently it's been a little bit more difficult
4733,351,why, um i don't know why i have like a lot of thoughts on my mind at night <clears throat> so i tend not to sleep very well and i wake up quite frequently during the night <clears throat>
4734,351,what are you like when you don't sleep well, um <clears throat> very groggy in the morning and um that's about it like during the day i tend to yawn a lot and my friends always are like oh why are you yawning so much are you disinterested <disisinterested> in what we're doing and then trying to tell them it's not that at all <laughter>
4735,351,okay,
4736,351,when was the last time you felt really happy, um probably christmas time when i was with my family 
4737,351,how did you feel in that moment,
4738,351,how did you feel in that moment, um just really happy and um feeling like everything was alright in my life  having a good sense of like where i was at that moment being present with myself
4739,351,uh huh,
4740,351,that's good,
4741,351,what would you say are some of your best qualities, um probably you know um let's see that's a hard question i think probably i can tend to read people kinda well sometimes and um  uh i like to say uh i'm good at like being a good friend to people being a good family member um i'm a hard worker when i do have a job so <laughter> 
4742,351,mhm, um
4743,351,is there anything you regret, um sure i mean it's life so of course there's regrets um one that comes to mind is um the wish that i don't eat as much so i can be a lot more healthy <laughter> 
4744,351,what advice would you give yourself ten or twenty years ago, um don't take things so seriously <laughter> um enjoy being youthful and um i think that's it <laughter>
4745,351,okay,

4747,351,wow,
4748,351,that sounds interesting, yeah it was awesome
4749,351,how did you decide to do that, um i was really kind of like um  reading people and so i decided to major in psychology <clears throat> so uh and then i went a worked in a um mental health facility and did research um with them with um with drugs and depression and things like that so it found like a good niche for me

4762,352,where are you from originally , i'm from oklahoma 
4763,352,really , mhm yup oklahoma city 
4764,352,what are some things you really like about l_a, uh the weather is great i love being near the ocean and the palm trees and uh mountains i just love it here <laughter>
4765,352,how easy was it for you to get used to living in l_a, um it was pretty easy there's a few differences it's a huge city compared to where i'm from so traffic has definitely been an adjustment for me <laughter> 
4766,352,why'd you move to l_a, um i just always wanted to live in california uh hated being landlocked in oklahoma just wanted to get out to the west coast be near the ocean  
4767,352,what'd you study at school , i studied psychology and minored in art 
4768,352,are you still working in that , um no not at the moment 
4769,352,what do you do now, um well actually i think i misunderstood your question i'm not still working on my degree but i am working in the field of psychology i well i just got hired working at a group home for teenage boys who have been in trouble with the law 
4770,352,what's your dream job , my dream job oh  i don't really know i think i just wanna help people however i can and um i just like working with people in the realm of psychology so i think i may already have my dream job <laughter>
4771,352,what do you do to relax , to relax i like to read or watch movies um i like to go to the beach and just watch the sunset or um hang out with friends 
4772,352,what are some things that make you really mad , things that make me really mad um probably injustice towards other people um people being mistreated or abused um and people being lied to and deceived including myself i hate being lied to <laughter> 
4773,352,what do you do when you're annoyed , when i'm annoyed uh depends on the situation but i try to just like count to ten and take a deep breath and and not let my emotions cause me to react in a negative way so i just try and like calm down before i say anything 
4774,352,how are you at controlling your temper , um it depends again on the situation and like who i'm angry with um most of the time i'm pretty good at controlling it but sometimes i think like like most people i'll lash out at the people that i'm closest to at times and and those moments i'm not that good at controlling it 
4775,352,when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about , <sigh> when was the last time i argued with someone it was probably with my parents um i've been having some some car trouble lately and i'm also running low on money so i'm sure i don't even remember exactly but i'm sure we kind of probably fought about the fact that i you know need to be more self-sufficient and independent take care of my own <laughter> things like car issues 
4776,352,how close are you to your family , i am very close with my family they're still in oklahoma but i talk to them on the phone all the time 
4777,352,who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life , oh definitely i mean my mom i think um she's probably the person that i'm closest to and she just  she's a great role model she's a wonderful person and she's very hardworking and very unselfish and i just wanna be like her in those ways 
4778,352,what's one of your most memorable experiences , oh probably the time i went bungee jumping over the nile river in uganda um i still kinda have flashbacks of that moment just freefalling it was like the coolest experience ever and i love doing things that are crazy like that so it was a fun time <laughter>
4779,352,do you travel a lot, yeah well i have <ha> i have traveled a lot nowadays i don't travel so much anymore but i used to work for a cruise line um norwegian cruise line and so i would go travel all the time with them and then i also did an eleven month long trip around the world uh it was a mission trip so i just went and helped out in different third world countries it was really cool 
4780,352,what do you enjoy about traveling , uh i just love going to different places seeing new places and meeting all different types of people um because it's easy to just like get so absorbed in your own small bubble that you forget that there's a huge world out there and there's all different types of people with all different types of beliefs and it's just really cool to be able to branch out and see and meet those types of people and see just the diversity and the terrain of the earth even and the way that the earth looks in different places is cool 
4781,352,have you ever served in the military , no i have not served in the military <laughter> 
4782,352,have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d, nope
4783,352,have you been diagnosed with depression , no i've never been formally diagnosed although i would say i've probably diagnosed myself with depression um just after having studied it a lot in psychology throughout the years i've i'm probably ninety nine percent sure that i've struggled with depression off and on so yeah  
4784,352,how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep , lately it's been pretty easy but throughout the years i've definitely had a lot of issues with insomnia um just like either not being able to fall asleep or just like waking up constantly throughout the night and so right now i'm not really experiencing too much of that but in the past it's definitely been an ongoing issue for me  
4785,352,what are you like when you don't sleep well , i'm not a pleasant person when i don't sleep well sleep is extremely like important for me i think maybe more so than a lot of people i i like need good sleep to function 
4786,352,how have you been feeling lately , i've been feeling really good um  over the past several months i was unemployed um after coming out here and that was really really tough um and i just recently got offered my job um just like last week so i definitely think i've been going through a lot of crap and just a lot of depression but it's like lifted a lot of it has been lifted off me because i don't have that pressure any longer of like how am i gonna make ends meet this city's really expensive and i don't have a job and so i feel i feel much more relieved than i have been feeling which is good <laughter>
4787,352,have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately , um yeah well i mean just like i said over the past week or so i've become a lot more  positive i was kind of like feeling a bit like a hermit in a way it's just hard like being in a new city and not really knowing too many people and of course like i said not having a job kind of causes you to kind of just like be in your own shell i guess and that was kinda how it was how it's been for me and um just since i got offered the job i just have so much more confidence and like positivity that um things are are starting to work out for me which is good <laughter>   
4788,352,when was the last time you felt really happy , oh it was probably a couple of days ago actually i went um  i went to explore a part of the south bay area that i hadn't really been to before and it was i was just gonna go for a jog along the beach and it was really foggy outside and then the fog started to lift and um it was just beautiful and then i i went for a drive up off kind of off this like cliff where there's beautiful scenery that i'd never seen before and i just like was overwhelmed with how pretty it was and i was just like oh i can't believe that i get to live here so that was definitely a happy moment for me <laughter> 
4789,352,how would your best friend describe you , my best friend would probably say that i'm very daring and bold and fearless um that i'm unique and artistic and i don't i would guess that she'd probably say that i'm a non-conformist i don't really think the way that a lot of people do and i question everything so which can be a good or bad thing but yeah <laughter> 
4790,352,what are you most proud of in your life , um  probably just like the fact that i i really try to live my life with like no regrets and just i try to live a very exciting life in a way and i think that especially ever since i finished college and have been traveling like i have and i've tried moving all different places by myself so i think just the fact that i i'm not really afraid i don't let things hold me back i just if i want something or if i wanna do something i can just do it and i guess in a way like i like that about myself and the fact that i'm really independent and can just go and do whatever i feel like doing even if it's hard i still i'm proud that i've overcome a lot of those struggles 
4791,352,is there anything you regret , oh there's like minor things that i regret throughout my life but there's not anything really major 'cause i think pretty much everything that i've done i've learned from whether it's good or bad so i wouldn't really change anything 
4792,352,what advice would you give yourself ten or twenty years ago , oh <sigh> i would say i would tell myself when i was a kid that i  should just keep dreaming big and don't let anything that anyone says like stop me from believing that anything's possible because um i guess as i've grown into an adult i've really seen and started to really believe that truly anything is possible and if you really want something you can go after it and you can get it so i would just tell myself to never give up and just always believe that you can do what you wanna do 
4793,352,tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed , oh  let's see that's kind of hard <laughter>  um oh i guess i went home recently for christmas back to oklahoma and um i got to see some of my friends from college that i hadn't seen in some of 'em i hadn't seen in like since i graduated so um which has been like four years ago so um it was really awesome just to go out with them and we went to dinner and we went out afterwards and just had a good night and it was really really fun 
4794,352,okay i think i've asked everything i need to, cool
4795,352,thanks for sharing your thoughts with me , you're welcome

5076,356,mhm,
5077,356,that sucks , that part does the free rent part is very good 
5078,356,what's one of your most memorable experiences , oh gosh my most memorable experience that's hard to say  um  well i mean there's good and bad memorable experiences 
5079,356,whatever comes to your mind , oh well i guess some s s s like sport success when i was in high school there was a few of the things that i was happy about and some art pieces i've made were memorable and  some bad things would be my father's death you know but those are very memorable not good though 
5080,356,mhm,
5081,356,who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life , uh  well my parents and my i i have a lot of brothers and sisters uh so <s> so the my family
5082,356,how close are you to your family , uh fairly close but they most of them live around l_a uh there's a few that are from far <f> distant <di> uh distant my brother lives in new york and   my other brother lives in maui <clears throat> 
5083,356,wow, mhm
5084,356,what do you think of today's kids, oh mostly very talented <ss> um just um more involved in technology than maybe i was or am and they're um i think they're more of a hive mind than when i grew up just seems like they were all hooked into social media 
5085,356,yeah,
5086,356,i understand,
5087,356,what do you do to relax , uh go on a walk or watch television 
5088,356,mhm, or play with my computer  and uh
5089,356,what are some things that make you really mad, um well  there's some <so> some uh  there's some kind of uh  injustices that happen in not not <n> not big deals but for example our parking situation got worse with some new district parking eh that's kind of upsetting and the city doesn't seem to wanna 
5090,356,oh , uh make any exceptions or change some rules  and also uh some unfair things at work sometimes happen that are upsetting <ups> uh that are upsetting
5091,356,can you give me an example of that , uh yeah i worked for <f> in school <sch> uh uh at a high school <sch> i worked at a high school dance uh this last weekend and when we arrived at the site   the people at the site said we couldn't set up all of our equipment and backdrops and things at the location where we were assigned to do it that we had to go outside  and then to get an okay to go inside because being outside we weren't prepared for nor <no> nor told in advance that we were to be outside um it delayed our setup time and that doesn't <does> wouldn't have bothered me except that on monday morning um the school called <call> called our boss and complained that we were late setting up when it when they told us to wait for them and we told them we would be delayed if we wait and did we still get a complaint so that that part is upsetting and  and our work doesn't back us up the at the office they just need to please the school to maintain the account so uh often when that something like that happens it means they will not send you out to work at that school again which to would translate into less payroll hours for the the photographers that were on that job 
5092,356,oh no, that's yeah that's how they do things so that that is upsetting 
5093,356,how do you cope with them , uh most of the time that will i i dust off my resume <laughter> and start looking for other situations that are that might be better um 
5094,356,that's good , yeah 
5095,356,how are you at controlling your temper , uh pretty good <sigh> i i i usually xxx might uh i in the moment i don't really lose it but xxx later i might um vent or something like that but on the spot <sp> on the location i wouldn't do that 
5096,356,mhm,
5097,356,when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about , um well just today um we have a uh schedule <sc> tight schedule today and i have a friend that i'm car <c> sharing a car with today and uh we we were arguing where to go first  and um so we compromised and did most of her things and one of my things then after  this <th> this was one of the things is over then we're gonna do some more of her things so but it
5098,356,that's good , yeah 
5099,356,have you ever served in the military , no
5100,356,have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d, post-traumatic stress syndrome is that what that is 
5101,356,mhm, uh no i have not
5102,356,have you been diagnosed with depression , yes 
5103,356,how long ago were you diagnosed , oh <sigh> i'd say nineteen eighty yeah i think believe it was nineteen eighty
5104,356,that's a long time , yeah 
5105,356,what got you to seek help , um well my father noticed some symptoms my father is just well he's passed away but he was a psychiatrist 
5106,356,what were your symptoms , um well i wasn't sleeping i was laying around the house  um i was waking up at noon <laughter> something like and i didn't have a um focus like for getting a job it wasn't clear enough uh i i remember some job interviews that i'd go to their front door and then i wouldn't go in <laughter> and i think that was all all part of depression 
5107,356,yeah ,
5108,356,did you think you had a problem before you found out , yeah i thought i had a problem but i didn't know what it was 
5109,356,do you still go to therapy now , no
5110,356,why did you stop , uh well eh i went for three years and then the psychiatrist said that  he thought that i was done <laughter> but uh and i and i i did get to a much better place i have to watch all the time to see what's going on with depression so i think i i'll have good days and bad days 
5111,356,what sort of changes have you noticed since you've been going to therapy, um i think therapy makes you see what the um  like the i i thought of it as a filter or wearing a pair <pa> as if you were put on a depression pair of sunglasses you don't really you see everything through that so you have to kinda <k> i have to sort of try to take the those glasses off for a little bit and double check am i really perceiving these things accurately  or am i seeing it through a depressed viewpoint and i try to look for clues about that  
5112,356,that makes sense ,
5113,356,mhm,
5114,356,how have you been feeling lately , i think i'm um slipping back a little bit uh uh i don't do well during unemployed periods i've noticed in my path in my past and um right now we have a work slow down so it's easy to slip back into sleeping too late or putting things off because the schedule's too wide open for for me for me personally as a depressed person i think that structure is really important it um
5115,356,yeah , it gets you out of bed and you have to get somewhere in time and deal interact with people is all those are all beneficial things for someone who's tends to be depressed  
5116,356,uh huh,
5117,356,have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately , uh  well i don't know if it's changes as i a little bit i just tend to be focused on some things that are probably not that um uplifting let's say uh but it's more negative like i have <ha> have been sort of thinking about how um um soldiers in the past uh i don't know why but like the in during the roman era <er> era or the greeks <gree> ancient greeks how it would've been like to be in a in a frontline battle with  mm you know just crude <cru> kind of crude <cru> in my opinion crude weapons and no medical help and  the i don't know i seem <se> my mind seems to go there a lot where i'm just thinking about that and i've been looking <look> looking at it and reading books about that or um video clips on youtube and
5118,356,yeah , eh things like that or um some other things <thi> other uh kinda like terrible doom type themes like i was watching on the animal show like crocodile attacks and things like that  where probably shouldn't dwell so much on that 
5119,356,okay ,
5120,356,yeah,
5121,356,is there anything you regret , oh you mean in life in general yeah well i think i regret not finishing college i think i had a i think i was <wa> uh was going into depression right then and wasn't coping in my senior year very well and um didn't really i didn't get out of college with a degree although i was there seven years but uh so that's very that's a big regret that i have
5122,356,hmm,
5123,356,what advice would you give yourself ten or twenty years ago , um  i think it would've been to um  at certain points i probably should've sought <so> um sought therapy and also probably some uh outside help just with um getting through finals just the logistics i had i was an art major and i had no car so   a a lot of the art projects and things were difficult to move back and forth and and also to uh meet at away locations i think it probably would've been worth it to   do whatever it took to get a car <laughter> at that time
5124,356,uh huh , so 
5125,356,i see what you mean ,
5126,356,what would you say are some of your best qualities , um  well i'm i've been told i'm very patient  and also i have um some original original artistic ideas   so  um those are those are good qualities i'm very loyal and and also um  you know i support my friends i'm fairly generous with them  so

5452,363,what are some things you really like about l_a, um it's uh center of everything eh you can get to all the places you need to go to uh eh without having to drive very far um i like being in the city
5453,363,mhm,
5454,363,what are some things you don't really like about l_a, well being in l_a also you're dealing with traffic a lot of congestion and um obviously uh the environment as far as uh the air quality is not that great but
5455,363,yeah, you know you live with that
5456,363,i see what you mean,
5457,363,what did you study at school, um i was a business administration major so i studied business and um after i finished college i um uh pursued a career in retail operations
5458,363,are you still doing that, uh no i as a matter of fact i am not i kinda changed career uh over the last four or five years so i'm concentrating more on the human resources side of the business
5459,363,what made you decide to do that, um a couple of factors um i after working numerous years in the retail business i um switched over and worked in a uh creative business which was a graphic design firm and i uh captured a knowledge <knowl> a lot of knowledge um in the a in the human resources side because i was the operations manager slash benefits manager for a a small company
5460,363,are you happy you did that, yes i'm very happy i did that um i picked up on lot of knowledge and uh and it's very helpful
5461,363,that's great,
5462,363,i love my job you could almost say it's virtually made for me what's your dream job, <laughter> well my dream job is um i'm basically kinda doing what i wanna do now because i am a uh independent contractor i do freelance work as an h_r consultant using all the knowledge that i uh gained from previous jobs and um i utilize that with the flexibility to do the things i wanna do as far as personally and have the time i need to to do the things i wanna do and um obviously i worked hard early part of my career so the financial aspect of uh my retirement is already set in place so i do what i need to do as far as um maintaining a certain lifestyle but also i have i also enjoy what i do i'm not under as much stress as i used to be
5463,363,that sounds like a great situation,
5464,363,do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing, mm i'm not well i'm not totally outgoing but um i'm not i'm not extremely shy i'm probably right in the middle maybe more towards outgoing but i'm not totally outgoing i mean when i'm around other people i am uh in a social situation i i guess you could consider me an outgoing person but um obviously i do have my own little uh private issues that i keep to myself
5465,363,can you tell me about that, oh sure you know i have um uh couple years ago i had a heart attack and i had to have bypass operation and it had to
5466,363,wow, yeah it had to do with stress and things like that i don't talk about that much other than those around me that are close to me um if i meet someone new i don't just openly say well you know i've experienced this this and this so i just basically um if it comes up i won't deny it or if it comes up and if it's if it i feel like it's something to talk about i will talk about it
5467,363,okay,
5468,363,sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax, actually um my relaxation is um i'm currently um living with my mom my mother and uh she's a senior citizen and she's alone um so what i do for uh relaxation or to relieve stress is i actually help <he> help her do yard work take care of all the gardening and things like that and that's actually very uh therapeutic you know
5469,363,aw,
5470,363,how are you at controlling your temper, um i'm not um i'm not a short-fused kinda person it takes a lot to get me really angry so as far as um my temper's concerned there's not there's not much to that
5471,363,when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about, um i'm trying to think here <sigh> i can't recall when the last time it was but it was probably last year sometime when i um had a creditor that i was dealing with um being very difficult to work with um and i owed money as far as um some medical expenses that were incurred when i had my heart attack a few years ago and uh they weren't very understanding of the situation and i uh i really got a little upset about that because um i felt like i was being honest with them and i was i was more than willing to take care of my issues but uh they were playing hardball and i didn't care for that
5472,363,yeah,
5473,363,that sucks, it does <laughter>
5474,363,tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make, probably the hardest xxx decision i ever had to make was um it had to do with a life and death situation with my my stepfather who was battling uh prostate cancer and yeah uh making a decision with my mother whether to proceed with a procedure that was gonna either um help him or there was a slight chance it was gonna help him even though he was pretty terminal at that point or it would it would kill him you know um and that was really tough it was really tough decision to make but uh uh you know i i felt like if i didn't try and see if we could save his life <l> help save his life or if it we didn't take a chance and and take that extra step that i would regret it in the long run
5475,363,yeah,
5476,363,that sounds really hard, it is it was
5477,363,tell me about your relationship with your family, um well right now um i'm separated from my wife so uh she has her issues i have my issues but we are not divorced we're just separated and um we still have a relationship where we still speak to each other we just don't live together and the relationship with my mother's really great you know um she's very understanding i'm an only child so she likes having me around which is good because she's in her late she's in her later stage of her life she's eighty two years old
5478,363,wow, and and so she needs to uh i guess it's good that in in in it's own way maybe fate has taken place because you know eh someone eighty two years old by themselves in a huge house is not a good thing but with me there i think she feels <fe> there's a comfort level she feels with me there especially being her only child
5479,363,yeah,
5480,363,what's something you feel guilty about, probably the most guilty i feel about anything are are the things that i did to hurt my marriage um as far as um the things that i did the selfish things that i did when i was much younger that um obviously affected the relationship between myself and my wife
5481,363,can you give me an example of that, uh yeah i um got caught up in a situation where um i was working tremendous amounts of hours under a lotta stress my wife was also working a lotta hours in a job that she had and uh we were growing apart and um when she was away my form of release was to go uh to the casinos and gamble and so you know i spent a lot of time in in the casinos and what eventually happened was i spent a lot of money and obviously that was a major issue regarding our relationship had to do with trust because um it it was devastating to my wife
5482,363,yeah,
5483,363,how did you feel in that moment, i felt uh when <whe> when it when it came to light um i felt very guilty and i felt less than a human being at that point in my life
5484,363,i'm sorry,
5485,363,have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d, no not at all
5486,363,have you been diagnosed with depression, no not really no
5487,363,how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep, i don't have problems sleeping that's i i don't ever recall having any problem sleeping so no
5488,363,that's good,
5489,363,do you feel down, no not at all
5490,363,have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately, no uh i well i just <deep breath> the only thing i could say is um after i had my heart attack a few years ago um i don't let i find myself not letting the small details or small things in life bother me as much as they did before so i tend to be a little bit more easygoing and my friends and family have noticed that
5491,363,that's great,
5492,363,tell me about the last time you felt really happy, the last time i felt really happy um probably when i had a visit with my cardiologist after my heart attack and um he basically said to me that after many tests and many uh months of uh rehabilitation that he was happy to explain to me that there was no scar tissue no major scar tissue that had occurred with my heart because of my heart heart attack and that um i could count on living a pretty much normal life as long as i watched my diet and took my medications
5493,363,that's so good to hear,
5494,363,what are some things you wish you could change about yourself, well i guess number one thing is uh my physical being itself i like to be a little bit more healthier lose some more weight um just in general just be more healthier physically and as far as mentally um just not go back to those ways of thinking where i was doing the wrong things instead of the right things and not to be so selfish
5495,363,how do you cope with them, just one day at a time you know i just uh try to be at peace with my myself and try to have some peace of mind on a daily basis i meditate i read you know i read some books i watch t_v i i do things that i know that um if i can i if i can help myself i do things to help myself
5496,363,mm,
5497,363,is there anything you regret, well there's a lot that i regret obviously in my marriage uh my uh working career as far as i had a long career with this majors uh food chain and and i basically because of my gambling issues i ended up ruining a a very good career but um at this point right now there's not much i can do i can't change what's been done so i don't focus too much on the past i just look at what's in front of me and just focus on what's in front of me eh every day
5498,363,yeah,
5499,363,what advice would you give to yourself ten or twenty years ago, what advice <laughter> wake up and see <s> and see what you're doing to yourself and you know make the changes that need to be changed um you know <kno> uh you know i'm not a uh i'm not someone that's not intelligent but i was intelligent enough to know what's right from wrong and um scrubbed_entry you're what you're doing is wrong you need to change your behavior immediately
5500,363,uh huh,
5501,363,what are you most proud of in your life, probably the proud <pro> what i'm proud about overall is the fact that um i did all these awful things but deep down i don't think as a person i'm a bad person i have to remember that um when i was caught up in all the gambling and compulsive behavior it was because i had an illness a compulsive uh obsessive compulsive behavior that made me ill and um that i was a sick person just trying to become healthy and every day that's what my life is about it's about recovery and uh just making sure that uh i do the right things from the time i wake up in the morning to the time i go to sleep at night one day at a time
5502,363,yeah,
5503,363,how hard is that, it's not as hard as you think it's but it is a process where you need to be diligent about your behavior and your routines and um just know that what's not right for you you know it could be okay for other people to do certain things but i cannot do those things anymore
5504,363,mhm,
5505,363,how would your best friend describe you, um most of my best friends can uh describe me as probably easygoing generous um a nice person to be around and um you know they were obviously a little shocked when they found out of all my issues uh related to the gambling and the my and the break-up of break-up of my marriage which you know it's still not over yet you know
5506,363,uh huh,
5507,363,tell me how you spend your ideal weekend, well my ideal weekend starts off usually um after i have breakfast with my mother early in the morning like around six o'clock um i go to a local park and uh it's about this park is probably laid out where you can walk up a hill and down a hill it's about three and a half miles and i take a brisk walk in the morning um get my blood flowing and get my heart rate going and then after that i um you know go home um work in the yard a few hours take a shower and relax and then just uh kinda kick back for the rest of the day and then the the the next day i i do the same thing again in the morning i go for a walk work out in the yard watch t_v whatever just relax that's how a weekend goes for me
5508,363,nice,
5509,363,okay i think i have asked everything i need to,
5510,363,thanks for sharing your thoughts with me, and thank you
5511,363,goodbye,
5512,364,hi i'm ellie thanks for coming in today i was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment i'm not a therapist but i'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you i'll ask a few questions to get us started and please feel free to tell me anything your answers are totally confidential are you ok with this, i am
5513,364,okay,
5514,364,so how are you doing today, i feel pretty good i'm wide awake i had an good breakfast and a nice cup of coffee and uh i have an easy day today so i am just gonna chat with you then i'm going to the gym and run some errands so i plan on having a nice day today
5515,364,that's good,
5516,364,where are you from originally, i was born and raised in los angeles and i'm one of the few locals from around here and uh i went to school away and uh but i'm one of the few natives that are actually in los angeles
5517,364,really, yes i am
5518,364,what are some things you really like about l_a, i like the weather having owned a vacation house in another state that i found to be too hot and humid in florida i love the weather here um i like the culture i like the diversity i like the familiarity i like that beaches uh but i also like that just an hour and a half away one can go to the desert say palm springs palm desert but also another hour and a half two hours away you can go to arrowhead or big bear and go snowboarding or skiing or things like that and uh i think it's a great place to live
5519,364,yeah,
5520,364,i see what you mean, thank you
5521,364,what are some things you don't really like about l_a, well more of some maybe some of the things i don't like about l_a or say california in general say like the high tax rate which the state tax rate is up to thirteen point something now which is gonna chase business out of here also the regulations i'm a small business owner so all the regulations are clearly affecting business so many of my peers have moved their businesses to texas arizona nevada etcetera some of the other western states that are less regulated and uh that's a big problem here in uh uh california
5522,364,that sucks, it really does most people don't understand it but  it's uh also uh you know besides the high taxes you know there's a big immigration problem which being born and raised here most people don't see that but it's a big tax on the social service system and that's what makes our taxes uh so high until they really secure the borders and get that taken care of
5523,364,mm, so that's you know but people don't seem to want to really deal with uh deal with that but it clearly affects businesses because from all the other things that's why our taxes are so high and people are moving out of state
5524,364,mhm,
5525,364,i'm sure you can tell by my shoes i'm not much of a world explorer do you travel a lot, i enjoy traveling i've been to sixty six countries and uh i don't travel as much as i used to but i've traveled quite a bit and i've learned a couple of languages and uh i served
5526,364,like what, i'm sorry
5527,364,like what, uh i didn't really understand uh your question when you said like what i don't think you understood what i said but i'll just go back and i've been all through europe eastern europe asia south america north africa um and i enjoy that and enjoy warm climates now especially where you can go and relax and there's warm water to surf 'cause the cold water kind of makes my back stiffen up and i also like to exercise and surf and do yoga and work out and uh i try to eat healthy and uh that's a big part of my life
5528,364,i'd love to hear about one of your trips, oh sure um one of my favorite trips of all time was i used to when i was younger see how many countries i could do in a relatively short period of time say in a three or four week span but about ten years ago we actually went to paris and stayed for about a week and really got to know the city even though i'd been there about ten times we got to know the city really well which was great really lived like a local and rented a small flat and cooked and did our own shopping but really having been there so many times i really never stayed for more than three or four days it was fun to stay there for about you know almost a month and uh really get to learn the city and it was fun even though i grew up in l_a i grew up taking french which there wasn't a big spanish speaking population when i when i was younger my mother insisted that all of us kids take french even though spanish would've been a lot more valuable but i took french uh all through uh elementary junior high and uh high school
5529,364,nice, so it was nice to practice my french even though i don't remember a whole lot and even though i stopped speaking french with the french you know and my accent is not the greatest so after a couple sentences they start talking english to me
5530,364,(laughter, <laughter> so that was a
5531,364,what did you study at school, uh i have a few different degrees so uh i was a naval science major as an undergraduate and uh that was fun and i also have a masters uh degree in economics and i have a degree in crisis management so
5532,364,what made you decide to do that, uh i found them um interesting and uh it was something that i wanted to do where i went to college i went to the naval academy i went there to play sports and  i found it real interesting being from southern california going to school in maryland and i originally wanted to be a doctor but once you start going to school for a little bit you change your mind etcetera so
5533,364,mhm,
5534,364,are you still working in that, um i'm actually in the wholesale business now for wholesale distributors of furniture products and it was a family business but i went to work there a number of years ago well you know my grandfather and recently father passed away so i sort of run a eighty year old family business and it's pretty interesting i like it having grown up around it but it's different than other jobs i've had in the past
5535,364,what's your dream job, hm actually probably my dream job i think cooking and staying at home this fun i've changed so much i enjoy cooking and staying at home and uh uh i would probably like to stay home and raise kids because i do have one daughter and uh
5536,364,aw, you know didn't get to spend as much time with her when she was younger as i would've liked but i think i would be better than say a lot of women i know  that want to work i actually like cooking and hanging around the house and taking care of kids you know that i like doing i'm always on a part time basis but do that having pretty much worked most of my life it seems like boy that would be fun to stay home and uh do that having pretty much worked most of my life so
5537,364,yeah, probably never happen but it sounds something that to me would be fun
5538,364,do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing, uh i think i'm um generally more reserved and shy with strangers but when i get to know someone or feel comfortable i think i'm more of an extrovert whereas most strangers might think i'm more introverted but i think i'm when i feel comfortable with certain people and i don't know what it is i can meet a stranger and  be totally confident or people that i might've known for years either from a personal or a business situation and be more um introverted i mean i just i just go with the dynamics but i think my outward manifestation is to be a little more shy in general and reserved <reser> i use like to use the term reserved
5539,364,okay,
5540,364,sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax, oh wow that's a great idea i used to have that on uh one of my i have uh several computers at home and that used to be one of my screensavers uh as well i usually tend when when i need to relax or had a stressful day or stressful personal events or going for a long walk or going for a long walk or going for a long walk i usually find exercise whether it be yoga or going for a long walk or going to the gym or going for a run or going to the beach you know maybe going surfing when the weather's warm i don't surf in cold weather anymore because it makes it gives me like a brain freeze even though i've surfed for you know over thirty years i had it uh i usually find exercise helps me relax the best or sometimes just vegging out on the couch in front of the t_v i find very relaxing <laughter> but i like that screensaver i used to have that on one of my uh screensavers at home but
5541,364,that's great, yes that was uh that was it but that's one of the things that took me a number of years to master though were my relaxation skills i probably didn't have them the best in my twenties but over the years i think i've gotten better uh at the
5542,364,yeah, i think that's a key thing and i think as we mature as we learn how to do that i wish i'd learned how to do that and be a little more how do you had had the skills earlier
5543,364,how are you at controlling your temper, i like to think i'm pretty good i think i'm a lot better as well as that as i've aged um you know i i am more likely to think before i speak now whereas say twenty years ago i was more likely to act before i fought so i might've said more things that i in a whatever tense situation whether it be personal or a work situation um but i've never had a a a violent temper but i would have a temper where i fly off the handle instead of taking a deep breath and reflecting on it i think i'm a lot better at that  now than i was say in my teens or twenties
5544,364,uh huh, so when i think a lot of that comes i think the keyword there is maturity
5545,364,when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about, oh wow you know i haven't really had an argument with anybody in several years <y> what i would consider a traditional argument um probably um my ex wife a number of years ago wehad an argument basically just over my daughter and it wasn't anything violent but it was heated just basically one of the reasons we didn't weren't married our values were so different just our ideas of parenting and uh just uh outlook on life was so different i think that caused us to butt heads but it was just i don't know if i'd call it an argument but it was more of just a uh one of those let's agree to disagree butt heads so
5546,364,how did you feel in that moment, i felt like i was talking to a wall and i actually felt more mad at myself that i should've learned earlier in life that boy that before you get married to someone have children with them that's the kind of discussions that people should usually have but you're not really thinking of that because sometimes when we're younger we're looking at boy how does that i look great on paper to her and she looked great on paper to me but you know i'm pretty easy going and i have different ideas on raising children how she did and that was more not that she was wrong and i was right not that i was right and she was wrong it was just how we were raised and our just different views and we never really discussed those things but it was really just fundamental reasons why we butted heads and more weren't really a good match
5547,364,yeah, whereas other things looked good you know on paper to both of us
5548,364,mhm,
5549,364,tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently, hm there's one recently my father passed away uh recently
5550,364,i'm sorry, thank you and really because in our religion you know you plan a funeral very quickly you know typically within a couple of days and i really only invited very very close friends and family members i was more or less in charge of it my dad was remarried but his widow was sort of not really up to it so i took care of it and i wish i had invited a i kept it very private and really just told people after the fact that he knew that would've liked to have come tp the service had they known about it so i really only invited because just the time pressure really just a handful of people but now as time's passed i wish i'd invited more of his friends instead of just two or three close friends you know ten or twenty acquaintances and people he knew from business or over the years and i really just and even distant family members i really just told after the fact i really didn't invite them because i was under a time pressure but i could've easily done it via email or it's hard to call everybody personally but i wish that's something 'cause people have expressed a little they were upset with me when my other family members threw it all back at me oh you didn't tell me 'til after the fact that you know so and so had passed so they all threw it at me because i was more or less doing it so i wish i i did that differently but i did the best i could at the time so i'm not really mad at myself about something i probably should've been more prepared for also something <s s something> that was coming was inevitable so
5551,364,i see,
5552,364,tell me about your relationship with your family, um well both my parents are recently uh deceased in the last couple of years and i had a brother that i have three younger brothers one of who passed away in december and we're not super close like i always like i look at other families we were just never like that norman rockwell uh painting i guess we're also uh different
5553,364,uh huh, and uh i have a close relationship with friends and a more distant relationship with family not that it's strange but i wish it was more like boy one of those families that got together every sunday and had dinner and all that we just never did that because we're all all so uh uh different
5554,364,yeah,
5555,364,i understand, yeah it's yeah just being that's how it is but you know to strangers and most people i just say you know howdy the family everybody's great you know but i think every family has their own sort of stuff
5556,364,have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d, um no but i thought probably i could've had it before from some other events in my life and i just wasn't sure i've had been to some therapy in the past just from you know uh i was in the military and i was never really sure if that that's exactly what it was but i think i function pretty well but i just wasn't sure that i had been to some therapy and counseling over the years
5557,364,why'd you decide to enlist in the military, i didn't enlist i was an officer i went to one of the service academies
5558,364,how old were you when you joined the military, that um seventeen i started when after high school and i went to a service academy so it's more prestige it just isn't enlisting it's the hard where i went it's the hardest school in america to get into
5559,364,you were very young weren't you, i was but same age as everybody else that went there
5560,364,did you ever see combat, uh we did nineteen eighty three
5561,364,can you tell me about that, um just basically wasn't anything intense it was just we were just around some we were just we weren't allowed to carry ammunition we were just our position were just shelled at the time and poison gas was sprayed on us so
5562,364,wow, that was a it wasn't it wasn't anything too uh too intense it was a lot you know because it the service i was in the training was way more intense than any actual combat situation
5563,364,why, that's because they train you well it's like you practice harder than you play if you're an athlete if you play football you practice harder than you you actually play in the game and the same with uh you know if you're in a combat unit
5564,364,mhm,
5565,364,how did serving in the military change you, well it made me more patriotic having grown up in california whereas people who are from all over the country and i got to meet whereas most of say my friends who grew up in affluent los angeles like i did never really went out and met a lot of americans and people from different backgrounds and i ended up becoming uh just more patriotic and a deeper sense of pride in the country whereas you really don't grow up with that in southern california whereas someone in texas or kentucky or tennessee or georgia north dakota south dakota montana
5566,364,right, grows up with that kind of uh pride so i thought it was good and it unlike so many of my friends that they don't know any there's any life between malibu and manhattan
5567,364,what did you do after the military, uh i went to graduate i was still in the reserves but i went to graduate school and i got two graduate degrees and i went to work in private enterprise uh didn't care for it then i joined the fire department i was a fire fighter and paramedic for a number of years and then after i got divorced it was harder to do the custody situation with my daughter so i went to work in a family business and that's pretty much my career in a nutshell
5568,364,how easy was it for you to go back to civilian life, um at first it was because i had such a bearing in my butt from the way i walked i talked and again i was an officer uh you were very regimented on the way you dressed in your private time it was harder took me awhile to be able to come back to los angeles uh because it was just so uh so different i think i handled it better than most i have a stronger personality so but
5569,364,mm, it was a great experience
5570,364,that's good,
5571,364,how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep, um it all depends if i exercise regularly and i don't eat too late and things are going well in my life i generally sleep pretty well even though i might have to get up and go to the bathroom once during the night um but i generally sleep uh i generally sleep pretty well
5572,364,how have you been feeling lately, i feel pretty good lately you know i've been like anybody else more periods of blue in your life but boy the last few months i feel great pretty much
5573,364,have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately, no not really i seem i think i seem a little happier more content lately
5574,364,okay,
5575,364,have you been diagnosed with depression, um i've had thought maybe in the past because i do have a family history of it and you know it wasn't anything real too debilitating and i wasn't able to really function on my own but i was concerned with it and sought counseling
5576,364,do you feel like therapy is useful, i do i was really against it in the past and until after i went i mean i wish i went more say during my uh my marriage over the course of uh my life now i think it's very useful however in the past i was one of those i grew up hearing that it was just ridiculous and it was a waste of money etcetera but i think it's a useful tool if you're open to it
5577,364,what got you to seek help, oh just some questions i wanted just an honest opinion outside of friends or strangers from a professional you know about life relationships and sometimes it's good talking things out with a a professional even though i wouldn't see someone like you in real life i prefer someone who's older than i am a little more life experience than someone who's maybe younger
5578,364,i understand, so but yeah i think it's a useful tool and i really did a hundred and eighty degree switch on that
5579,364,do you still go to therapy now, uh i don't go now i'm sorta taking a break from it but i'm not against it if i have some issues i wanna bounce off i do have someone that i go to
5580,364,okay, yeah
5581,364,how has seeing a therapist affected you, i think it's nice you know they really if you go to someone who's good and again i've been to a few different people and sort of therapist shopped they really don't tell you what to think which i think is great you know that's always in the past they just help you talk through your your thoughts and your feelings and let you decide for yourself but bring a little clarity
5582,364,yeah, to the situation that's why i like talking to someone who has a lot more life experience and i generally feel more comfortable talking to a woman about that stuff than say to a man
5583,364,uh huh, so but it's um i think it's a a useful tool i got some good ideas and was able to it's nice balancing some things off totally someone who's unbiased and not in your day to day life instead of talking to a a romantic partner or a close friend who knows you but sometimes bouncing the people off of strangers is good
5584,364,uh huh,
5585,364,tell me about the last time you felt really happy, uh this morning i know this this is weird but i'm clearly someone and i'd say this as a joke to my friends and family and associates i clearly have i'm having an easy day today 'cause i knew we're having nice weather and i have a bunch of errands to run and i clearly have seasonal affective disorder but i woke up so happy today when i know it's gonna be eighty degrees out and when the weather's nice i'm generally a lot more happier than when the weather's [laughter] dark and blue and rainy and cold where i always i know that term so but i'm just well i woke up really happy today because i knew it's gonna be a nice day
5586,364,that's great, and i looked forward to feeling the sun so
5587,364,how would your best friend describe you, uh most of my friends i'm sort of a renaissance man i know a little bit about a lot of subjects i'm too smart for my own good and i'm a i know a a lot a lot of permeable things i'm pretty rational i'm very resourceful people always call me when they have issues and i help talk them through it or i'm resourceful and tell them where to go whether it's where to buy a new computer or buy a new car or you know i'm great with medical diagnoses uh and uh you know people also say i'm a lot of fun
5588,364,mhm, i'm fun to be with and um i also have i don't have a lot of grey areas people will either really like me or don't like me with me things are pretty much black and white i am what i am i don't b_s you know i'm the opposite of a politician so i don't tell people what they want to hear i don't be rude not rude to anybody but i pretty much call things as i see them
5589,364,yeah, so that's pretty much
5590,364,has that gotten you in trouble, no not really 'cause i do everything tactfully
5591,364,okay, i like to think i do
5592,364,is there anything you regret, uh probably just i probably spent more time with my parents before they passed but i was busy uh i probably wish i was able to spend more time with my daughter when she was younger uh but just a lot of it's very typical
5593,364,what advice would you give to yourself ten or twenty years ago, really to think things through a little bit more be a little less impulsive or have pretended to be more impulsive when i was younger than i am now i think that's that's it and i would look at things in the long term instead of looking in things in the short term you know when you make decisions or choices
5594,364,what are you most proud of in your life, um i'm proud of my daughter she's a nice young lady i am uh proud of my public service i've never done a job really for money of my military service and fire service um there are very few people like me who did it who are as had the background in education that i did but i like public service and um so i'm proud of uh that
5595,364,mhm,  proud of all the certificates i have hanging on my walls at home and degrees sort of like trophies i'm proud that i've been able to stay in good physical shape over the years and knock wood maintain good health
5596,364,okay i think i have asked everything i need to,
5597,364,thanks for sharing your thoughts with me, it was nice meeting you

5607,365,how does it compare to l_a, uh it's much different uh i don't know it's just <laughter> it's a lot more crowded here
5608,365,why did you move to l_a, to start a new life for myself
5609,365,how easy was it for you to get used to living in l_a, it wasn't very easy at all <sigh> uh it was uh it was quite rough at first but you know i'm still trying to get used to life here
5610,365,what are some things you really like about l_a, i've met some good friends here um you know i love the hollywood area um and just you know the mountains are beautiful that's kinda things i love

5614,365,i'm sure you can tell by my shoes i'm not much of a world explorer do you travel a lot, not really no i don't
5615,365,why, just haven't had the time or the finances to
5616,365,okay,
5617,365,what did you study at school, digital media
5618,365,that sounds interesting,
5619,365,how did you decide to do that, well i've always loved you know <deep breath> computers and you know designing things and uh i don't know i just kinda fell into it
5620,365,cool,
5621,365,are you still doing that, no i dropped out
5622,365,i love my job you could almost say it's virtually made for me what's your dream job, well i i guess my dream job would be working <deep breath> in something that uh i went to school for you know i i never really completed my education um but i guess it'd be great if i went you know back to school and you know finished you know my degree in digital media and uh you know finished and uh started working you know doing something in that field
5623,365,mhm,
5624,365,do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing, a little bit of both you know i i can be shy at times but i like to push myself to be outgoing you know it's kind of a a struggle for me but i i don't wanna be you know in a shell so i kinda force myself to be outgoing
5625,365,yeah,
5626,365,sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax, listen to music i uh sometimes just drive and um you know play music in my car and that helps me relax
5627,365,nice, or i smoke a cigarette
5628,365,like what, oh like what ooh um <laughter> just heavy metal that's all i listen to is metal
5629,365,awesome,
5630,365,how are you at controlling your temper, well <sigh> it depends on how high my stress level is and how angry i am but i i do my best to not get so pissed off <laughter>
5631,365,when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about, scrubbed_entry and i don't know she um she wanted me to to come and pick her up uh she was a little drunk and uh we just kinda fought over the phone all over some other things and i just ended not picking her up because of her attitude on the phone with me
5632,365,that sucks, <laughter> yeah it does
5633,365,what's something you feel guilty about, something i feel guilty about is uh not talking to my kids uh often or as often as i should i've just been so busy with trying to get myself all situated here that i i don't really have time to you know talk to my kids as much as i'd like to
5634,365,yeah,
5635,365,that sounds really hard, you have no idea
5636,365,do you find it easy to be a parent, um it's it comes natural but it's no way easy and uh it's it's the hardest job that i love to do but right now it's extremely difficult for me because they live so far away and i i made this choice to come out here to l_a and i feel bad that i don't see them you know but the reason i came out here was to better myself so i can provide for them
5637,365,yeah,
5638,365,what's the hardest thing about being a parent, fear you know fear <f> just fear will you know you <y> you fear what's gonna happen to your kids you fear that something awful is gonna happen and not seeing them it brings about that fear a lot more you know and i can't i can't always be there with them i can't see them you know it it wasn't as bad when i was living in florida um and i i at least i used to see them it wasn't very often but i used to used to see them now i don't see them at all and
5639,365,mhm, that's the that's the hardest thing i've had to do as a parent is to step away from my kids if only temporarily i don't know how long i'm gonna be here for i don't know what my future holds but the hardest thing is being so far away from them
5640,365,yeah,
5641,365,i'm sorry to hear that,
5642,365,what's the best thing about being a parent, just the the joy that they bring to me i mean i could be having a bad day and they just cheer me right up i mean i eh it sucks being away from them for for so long and they're so far away and just not seeing their faces that's it's it's the worst thing ever you know but i i love to just see their faces they they just bring a smile to my face and um
5643,365,mm, i don't know
5644,365,what are some ways that you're different as a parent than your parents, well um i think the fact that i can get down to their level um i'm i'm a bit goofier <laughter> as a father than my dad was with me my dad was you know strict all the time sure he used to you know laugh and play with us but you know he was always very reserved you know and he kinda held back a lot he a lot of his emotions just because you know he was a he was a strong very tough guy
5645,365,yeah, um but with me i i i'm very goofy and silly with my kids and i'm strict when i have to be but i always love to you know play around with them as much as possible you know not i don't want them to grow up too fast and that that may have been
5646,365,i see what you mean, yeah
5647,365,tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently, well <sigh> a situation that i wish i would've handled differently there's so many <laughter> uh i guess when i was still with my ex-wife in florida i wish i wouldn't have gotten so angry or i wish i wouldn't have let her get the best of my emotions she had a tendency to get underneath my skin and uh you know keep picking at me until i exploded and i allowed her to do that you know i i should've just walked away when i could and um you know not let my temper get the best of me
5648,365,okay,
5649,365,have you ever served in the military, no
5650,365,have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d, no
5651,365,have you been diagnosed with depression, no
5652,365,how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep, uh sometimes it's hard um sometimes i just lay awake in bed <sigh> you know thinking all the things that are going through my head all the you know all the stress that i'm going through with work and you know making sure you know wondering if i'm gonna if i'm gonna be able to make you know rent you know wondering what my kids are going through you know when i'll see them again if they even care about me anymore if they even know they have a father you know those are some of the things that run through my head and and that keeps me up at night sometimes
5653,365,do you think that maybe you're being a little hard on yourself, a little <sigh> but <sigh> you know i put myself in this situation so you know i i gotta bear with it you know i gotta you know you reap what you sow so i <sigh> i gotta deal with it in my own way
5654,365,have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately, lately um i've been trying to not think so much about you know all that's going into my life uh i try to distract myself and that kind of gets me in a better mood you know if i'm hanging out with friends or just watch a little t_v something to get my mind off you know all the stresses in my life um
5655,365,that's good,
5656,365,tell me about the last time you felt really happy, the last time i felt really happy uh was actually a couple of nights ago i went out drinking with um with a couple of my friends from work and um i don't know we just got pretty drunk and just <laughter> that kinda helped me to forget all the crap that was previously going through my head so if if i can distract myself if i can forget about all that other stuff then i'm happy <sigh>
5657,365,uh huh,
5658,365,what would you say are some of your best qualities, some of my best qualities i guess that i'm convincing <laughter> um uh i'm kind of like a i guess you would say a counselor to some people you know some of my close friends you know i may talk people into doing things that they may regret or i may i mean i'm sorry take talk people out of things that they you know may end up regretting or i may um you know just listen to people so you know eh i could say that you know i definitely you know listen to my friends and help them out in their time of need when they're going through something troubling times like like i'm going through
5659,365,can you give me an example of that, scrubbed_entry uh who lives in florida you know i talk to him every now and then and he's been having troubles with his girlfriend and you know i just kind of talk to him about his problems and listen i mostly <mo> i mainly listen because you know i don't think he has anybody else to listen to you know when i was living in florida i was uh very close with him so you know he he'd always relied on me and now that i'm here in l_a i don't wanna lose that you know connection with him because i mean i've always been there for him so he um he relies on me to listen to his problems and give him some advice you know about what i think you know he should do um so i think <th> i think he appreciates that and i and i'm glad that he you know relies on me for that uh he trusts me enough to tell me all that stuff
5660,365,yeah,
5661,365,that's great,
5662,365,what are some things you wish you could change about yourself, <laughter> i don't know <sigh> um sometimes i wish i wasn't so kind or generous it seems bad but sometimes i i don't know people may take advantage of me and i may not realize it and um i don't like saying no to people i like to always please people so if i can change that maybe i wish i wasn't such a people pleaser
5663,365,has that gotten you in trouble, sometimes financially in trouble <laughter> <deep breath> sometimes i you know it you know help others and not you know that may make me broke sometimes yeah i may not have enough to pay bills but i feel better helping people i don't know
5664,365,yeah,
5665,365,is there anything you regret, i regret not breaking up with my ex-wife sooner i regret <re> i regret <re>
5666,365,why, because she put me through so much crap in my life and um i was always trying to be a people pleaser i was trying to please her you know trying to please my kids as much as i can by not breaking up you know the family but you know there's only so much one person can take and i i think probably if i would've left sooner i may have been happier and things may not have gotten so out of control out of hand like they did you know during all those years with her so maybe if i would've got out sooner i don't know i would've been happier i guess
5667,365,i see,
5668,365,what advice would you give to yourself ten or twenty years ago, um it's okay to be selfish it's okay to you know think about yourself sometimes you know if you keep putting everyone ahead of you then you're not thinking about yourself you're not thinking about what makes you happy and even though pleasing people may make you happy uh you have to think about yourself sometimes too and about your needs because you know you play an important role in the lives of your close family members and um in order to keep everything afloat you sometimes gotta xxx gotta worry about the one person that's you know juggling everything and holding everything up which is yourself so be a little selfish sometimes it's okay
5669,365,right,
5670,365,tell me how you spend your ideal weekend, <laughter> i don't even know what a weekend is anymore my ideal weekend would be locked away alone in my room watching movies listening to music just with my cell phone off and not you know being with anybody or it could be out at a bar you know or you know watching a a metal show so i like to be alone but at times i i do wanna be out with uh with others i like you know being around people
5671,365,uh huh,
5672,365,how would your best friend describe you, crazy <laughter> he thinks i'm uh i'm crazy for coming out here but i guess he would say that i'm dedicated and that i'm strong-minded and that you know whatever i set my mind to i can do it you know no matter how hard it is i'm not gonna wimp out so i mean i i really respect him for giving me his insight but uh i guess yeah i guess he would say that i'm crazy but strong-minded <laughter>
5673,365,what are you most proud of in your life, my kids <sigh> you know that's the one thing that brings joy to me you know like real real joy are my kids and you know just having them in my life is is the proudest thing i can ever accomplish is just you know having them in my life and although i don't get to see them as much even <e> even when i think about them just thinking about you know how far they've gone you know what what they've accomplished in their you know in in their short time i mean eh yeah it makes me happy and i can't wait to see them again
5674,365,what's one of your most memorable experiences, one of my most memorable experiences i guess that would be scrubbed_entry in florida you know going to see our uh you know our favorite band skeleton witch it was it was a great night overall you know one of the night's i'll never forget just because we'd been looking forward to it for you know so many months and you know when it finally happened it was surreal um it was it was a great night after all and overall

5688,366,what are some things you don't really like about l_a, traffic <laughter> uh i would say traffic and the real estate prices are kinda crazy compared to the rest of the country but other than that then you know it's fine
5689,366,yeah,
5690,366,i'm sure you can tell by my shoes i'm not much of a world explorer do you travel a lot, i have traveled um i have traveled a bit um i would like to travel more though so but i've traveled to i've been to a few countries
5691,366,like what, um i've been to i won't say europe that's a continent um i've been to uh london <deep breath> um i was born here but my family's from nigeria so i've been to nigeria a few times i've been to denmark um amsterdam i've been to uh where else have i gone uh germany um and i think that's i think that's it yeah think that's it

5695,366,yeah, yeah
5696,366,i'd love to hear about one of your trips, okay well <sigh> uh let's see london i accident actually when i first heard about going to london i really didn't care for it 'cause i didn't know much about it the only i thing i remember <mem> i remember is watching mary poppins <laughter> and um
5697,366,(laughter, but um when i went there i absolutely fell in love with it um just <deep breath> it still <sti> it has the hustle and bustle of l_a but at the same time you can go at a very very slow pace um we didn't do any driving we just went on the tube um which is their like the underground subway station which i absolutely fell in love with and um just exploring um different parts of the city we went to you know big ben westminster abbey uh they actually had when i went there they had the premiere of um what movie was this um slumdog millionaire

5699,366,(laughter,
5700,366,that sounds like a great situation, yeah
5701,366,what did you study at school, uh business management and an option in human resources management what that means i have no idea <laughter>

5716,366,how did you feel in that moment, uh very uh i wouldn't say angry per se but i felt very kinda like i was losing control like um i'm the type where i i like to be in control of my emotions and of my thoughts and i feel once that patience is gone and i start going off it's kinda like this this uh you know i won't call it a blur but i'm very witty and quick with what i say so i will instantly say something that you know up not necessarily hurtful but um very direct and to the point and i make sure i get my point across

5729,366,tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory, hmm erase from my memory uh boy that's a good one <sigh> hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm uh wow erase from my memory uh i would say when i told <t> when i told my dad that he should act like a father
5730,366,can you tell me about that, maybe i shouldn't yeah there was um that was actually one of the times i <laughter> another time i went off usually with him um uh basically i had decided not to go to a private um not to go away for college um so <s> i went <we> i decided to stay local so i can look after my little brother and um <sigh> my senior year i was overloading with everything i had maybe like uh four a_p classes i was working at i was working three jobs at the time and i was also in track and field
5731,366,wow, so needless to say i was <laughter> i i i i was kinda like burning myself i was kinda like burning myself out and um i wasn't doing well in a_p calculus because i decided to go to a j_c first and transfer also to save money for college too and when i told him you know the teacher called saying i was falling asleep in class um just because mind you after school i'd work an eight hour shift 'cause i was a retail manager at the time so um and i'd come home after that shift to do homework mm calculus let alone um so uh um he would get upset and i told him i spoke with my counselor i already told him that i don't need that class to go to the j_c isn't something that i continue with so i'm just gonna i can't drop out at that point in time so i'm just gonna you know you know just just take the d or fail whatever and he didn't he didn't like that 'cause he is a teacher <laughter> i think maybe that's what maybe where it came from he's a teacher as well um and so he started blaming like my jobs and wanting to call my boss and it was it was just too much and i told him you know since you're my father you should act like it but i was it was a more aggressive <laughter> way i said it so that was um one thing oh i actually i do i i do remember i do regret one thing um and that is i wish i continued um with college throughout like i i burnt myself out um i was spreading myself too thin there was actually i was actually on track to graduate from college at i wanna say nineteen 'cause i started taking college classes in high school starting sophomore year
5732,366,wow, in high school but i with that that stuff and the stuff with my dad and working i just kinda like stopped going to school for a while and just worked but i went back to finish so but i wish i just would've continued maybe that's one small thing but that's something small though
5733,366,uh huh, yeah
5734,366,what would you say are some of your best qualities, hmm i'm very um i'm a very compassionate and understanding person um i like learning new things um i'm a very very happy person people come to me for advice i'm very objective i'll tell you the good the bad the ugly and um yeah those are some of my best qualities yeah and i'm fun i like to have fun i'll have fun in any situation i can make light of any situation like i'm the kinda type <ty> type of person i can break the tension in the room that's sort of that sort of uh <tisk> um personality trait

5736,366,what are some things you wish you could change about yourself, wish i was taller <laughter> um uh besides my height hmm i wish ah maybe i don't know if it's uh be more i won't say be more in touch with my emotions but i think i would say understanding people's how people feel about me in their shoes
5737,366,mhm, i think that would be one thing because i'm the type of person where people say that they love me or care about me and i'm like okay great thank you i appreciate that but i don't realize how much they do i think that's a realizing how much they care and love me
5738,366,mm, that's one thing i would like to get more of a grasp on

5746,366,okay i think i have asked everything i need to, yeah
5747,366,thanks for sharing your thoughts with me, oh okay thank you
5748,366,goodbye,
5749,367,hi i'm ellie thanks for coming in today i was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment i'm not a therapist but i'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you i'll ask a few questions to get us started and please feel free to tell me anything your answers are totally confidential are you ok with this, yes
5750,367,so how are you doing today, i'm okay um i'm a little pensive i guess a little uh down but more or less okay
5751,367,i'm sorry to hear that,
5752,367,where are you from originally, i was born in annapolis maryland
5753,367,really, on the east coast
5754,367,why did you move to l_a, originally i moved because i went to film school um and but then i decided to come i moved to washington d_c to do some work and now i'm back here again
5755,367,how easy was it for you to get used to living in l_a, it's very different um being from the east coast it just has a different feel to it um but living l_a is very has a very different kind of um attitude i guess and so it's a little difficult but i but i've gotten more used to it since i've been here
5756,367,how often do you go back to your hometown, uh not at all um when i left things got things were sort of i i lost my job out there and so i had to move out here kind of quick to um to be with uh some people who were gonna help me out and i'm just sort of i don't know if estranged is the right word but i'm just kind of not really speaking to my family or old friends that often
5757,367,how hard is that, it's not easy it's it's kind of um i miss i miss a lot of people i miss my old life before i lost my job um i miss um some friends um i miss a lot of the relationships that i had out there um so it's difficult i mean it weighs on my mind a lot um i feel like i failed and now i'm here and i can't seem to get back on my feet so it's it's it's hard
5758,367,yeah,
5759,367,do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing, depends on the situation i think i'm outgoing when i'm comfortable um and then i'm extremely outgoing but when i'm in a situation i'm not comfortable with i tend to be a lot more shy so that doesn't really answer your question but
5760,367,okay,
5761,367,sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax, um [clears throat] i have certain i do i do a lot of writing um i have certain music that i listen to as i'm writing and when i can when i can get really into that and sort of shut out the rest of the world um the music and the the thoughts just kind of happening really um it can it soothes me it's like it's when i feel most relaxed i guess
5762,367,mhm,
5763,367,when was the last time that happened, um a few weeks ago i guess i was i'd been working on a book on a on a on a novel and when i was really when i was really getting into writing it and um it was really working for me that was that was good that was really good i felt like i was accomplishing something and i felt really relaxed
5764,367,cool,
5765,367,what was it about, um it was about a guy who is searching for something it's it's uh it's his last day on earth and so he's going to find a person that he that he met and just was so struck by that he needs to he needs to find her and spend the last few minutes that he has on earth with her just because sort of uh it's sort of romantic adventure comedy kind of thing
5766,367,mm,
5767,367,what made you decide to do that, well i've always i've always been a writer part of the reason i came to l_a was because of screenwriting um so i wrote some screenplays and uh you know had a little success with that out here and but since since then i've kind of gotten tired of the limitations of the screenwriting and i've started to write more short stories and and longer just creative writing so i i've been meaning to write a novel but i was just waiting for the idea to to really hit me
5768,367,uh huh,
5769,367,how hard is that, it's not easy the [exhale] the parts the parts when it's good it's really good but getting there is sometimes a real struggle um i find it difficult i have a real love hate relationship with writing when i when i love it i just absolutely love it but sometimes i hate it because it's so difficult um but it's worth it for the times when it's when it's good
5770,367,yeah,
5771,367,i see what you mean,
5772,367,how are you at controlling your temper, good i don't i don't really have a temper i it's not i mean most of my anger that i have is directed inward as opposed to outward to other people um if something is really really stressful or if i'm in a situation like a very intense confrontation i can lose it but i probably <prob> that's probably only happened to me three four times in my whole life i mean generally i pretty much try to it when i'm upset i i get upset with myself not with other people
5773,367,when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about, um last night i guess well <weh> um i got in an argument about whether or not cleaning vegetables was necessary because of i forget it but it well no it was about whether you can clean vegetables after you cut them because i'd already started cutting the vegetables and i thought that would be okay so it turned into this big argument and we did google searches to figure out who was right and who was wrong and i
5774,367,(laughter, i ended up being wrong on that one but it is yeah that was it wasn't a blow up argument but it was a definite argument
5775,367,okay,
5776,367,what's something you feel guilty about, um uh a lot so much um uh i i i was in uh a relationship that i really really um that i really wanted to work and uh i ended up and it was partly due to i hadn't i was on i wasn't on the right medication and so i was going at like everything sort of spiraled out of control and i feel really guilty about the way that that ended and i mean i wasn't i wasn't mean but i was but i was getting more and more messed up and i couldn't stop it and it ended and so i feel really guilty about not doing enough and and not and and you know making her have to tell me that she never wanted to see me again so that was pretty that was pretty tough
5777,367,hmm,
5778,367,could you have done anything to avoid it, well some of it was was that i wasn't medicated properly i mean now i've been to a doctor and i'm on medication that's completely kind of i mean i still get i still get upset and i still get depressed but it's not like it was it's not i don't completely lose it for days at a time um so i mean i know there's a part of me that knows logically that it wasn't all my fault and that if i had if i had been able to deal with the chemicals in my brain then i would've then it would've probably be different if i was who i am now then i would've i would i would be i would be it probably would have gone very differently or maybe it wouldn't have but i mean i could have i don't know i don't know if i could've done anything different
5779,367,yeah, things being how they were
5780,367,do you think that maybe you're being a little hard on yourself, i mean it's it's possible uh i mean obviously yeah because i mean that's what i do i i take little things <thin> i mean i take little things and i just think about them all the time in my head until until it drives me crazy i dwell on stuff um and it's like any little detail that comes up i suddenly remember and it can just throw me off for a whole day i mean i still i still get i still get really uncomfortable and embarassed and then feel ashamed about stuff that i did in high school which was years and years ago which i shouldn't even be thinking about anymore 'cause it's so in the past but i still get that feeling like i'm right back there
5781,367,yeah,
5782,367,that sounds really hard, well it's it's not easy i've been trying to figure out ways to deal with it i i mean i dealt with it for a long time by by by drinking and and you know just trying to like slow my mind down that way um but you know since the medication it's been better it hasn't been impossible to deal with it hasn't been easy but it's but it's been better
5783,367,that's good,
5784,367,how do you cope with them, um well like i said i do a lot of you know if i'm if i'm writing or if i'm doing anything like i kind of have to almost be doing two things at once to occupy my brain completely um if i'm watching t_v i have to be playing a game on my phone if i'm using i'm the computer i have to be you know watching a t_v show or a movie on you know on in another window so that i can just keep my mind occupied during all of that um
5785,367,mhm, i just need i mean i i wish that i could just sort of let the thoughts come and deal with them but i just i can't yet
5786,367,are they triggered by something, they're triggered by everything pretty much anything that i that i see if i if i if i hear somebody with a dutch last name if i if i hear somebody talk about wisconsin if i hear you know people talk about just anything you know i can reach back and connect to to this it's really it's really i don't know that's the thing i mean i don't ever get a break from it
5787,367,that sucks, yeah
5788,367,how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep, um i don't know i'm a very light sleeper so i awake and asleep and awake and asleep <asl> i have no problem going back to sleep but i generally you know don't i don't know i never really needed much sleep so it's just only recently that i've really started to to like feel the effects of not getting enough sleep like i would i would usually stay up until two or three in the morning so that i could just be so exhausted that i could just conk out and wake up the next day and feel fine go to work um but now it's it's it's like if i do that i can't i still don't get enough sleep i don't conk out i still just sleep very lightly you know i get up i toss and turn all night you know and now it's just it's yeah i don't sleep too great right now
5789,367,mhm,
5790,367,what are you like when you don't sleep well, um pretty i mean i don't know it's hard to it's hard to know i i usually just kind of power through it and just i'm uh i'm like how i am now just i just feel bad
5791,367,okay,
5792,367,how long ago were you diagnosed, um i think about three three four years ago um it was when i i had been given taking stuff for anxiety for for years before that but then i finally got a psychiatrist who actually sat down and talked to me and said you've actually got this situation and we need to get you on the medication that you're on is not working you need to get on this new medication that will actually start to like even you out and heal you a little bit from all this so so yeah that was that was kind of a a turning point but unfortunately it happened after everything uh went bad so i don't know
5793,367,how did you feel in that moment, in the moment i don't know i don't really think i thought about it too much then but looking back on it i feel it really makes me angry it really makes me you know given where i am right now it makes me really angry that i'm that i had to that i i lost everything because because of chemicals in my brain because of things that i couldn't control and that you know the people that were supposed to help me weren't helping me i mean i was paying i was paying a lot of money to to go see doctors and they were doing and they you know it wasn't it was it didn't help it didn't work until until you know i managed to find somebody who did work and i just yeah so i'm i'm like thanks guys for helping but it was a little it's a little late now
5794,367,yeah,
5795,367,what got you to seek help, um there really wasn't any choice i had to i was i was a mess i was it was either i was i was self medicating it was affecting my work i mean it was everything was just at there was a point where i really realized that i mean i just had to like make this different but again it was too late because you know then my review came up a few months later and you know after after everything after being institutionalized once or twice and all this stuff you know they just decided that i was just not worth keeping around so they laid me off but it was at least that and not firing me but but but yeah but so i got help but it was but it wasn't soon enough
5796,367,okay,
5797,367,do you still go to therapy now, uh not not as much as i should um i go to a couple of meetings i go to i go to a_a so that i can um you know keep control of that aspect too <t> too and there's a there's a therapy aspect to that um unfortunately you know being unemployed my unemployment ran out you know i'm i'm you know i'm getting my medication from the city of l_a so you know i'm not really in a position to put money into seeing somebody so i have a psychiatrist that i go see but it's really very i've i've only seen her three times in the past year so it's basically to keep my medication coming
5798,367,okay, and then there's you <laughter>
5799,367,(laughter,
5800,367,yeah, right
5801,367,what sort of changes have you noticed since you've been going to therapy, well like i said i mean just the talk <tah> i mean the the let's just take the a_a for example because that's probably the closest <cloth> closest for that i'm seeing with therapy for now um just saying stuff outloud is just like getting getting this stuff out trying to figure out how to take that mess that's in your stomach and in your brain and make it into words and sentences that make sense that you can actually deal with is a big step like regardless of who you're saying it to whether it's a therapist or just a room full of of drunks you know i mean you're you're taking all that stuff that's that's really been killing you and you're making it into something you can deal with something that you can write down something that you can talk about as opposed to just letting it just sit there as this formless thing
5802,367,right, yeah
5803,367,how have you been feeling lately, um you know better than i than i have been um i mean it it sort of it goes <g> it has its ups and downs um you know i'm applying for jobs five six jobs or more a a day you know and never getting a response never getting an interview never even getting close to to to being self sufficient again um it's hard but that's like real world problems i feel like the chemical parts are getting under control like the the depression is getting under control so now it's just i have to deal with real life which is it just has its it's just its own own challenge
5804,367,yeah,
5805,367,it can be tough to find a good job these days, yeah
5806,367,tell me about the last time you felt really happy, um it was probably you know a couple years ago um i i was i mean the thing that immediately comes to mind uh is everything was going well at my job i was making these great videos with with this person that i that iwas having a relationship with and we were really close we were having fun together and we went out and got a christmas tree and we spent the all this time picking out the perfect christmas tree and it was just feeling like a part of somebody's life and feeling like a part of the bigger the bigger life that's that's out there you know like what normal people feel you know for that instant i felt like a normal person doing a normal thing with a pretty girl who he really really liked a lot and you know everything was going really well and i mean it wasn't going really well because it was all messed up but for that instant i felt like a normal person a normal happy person and part of what makes it so hard now is knowing that i don't know if i'll ever feel that again so
5807,367,uh huh,
5808,367,what are you most proud of in your life, um probably the probably this educational <educary> educational series i did uh an educational uh video series i did for the national science foundation um it was it it was really hard and it but in the end it turned out really good and you know i'm hoping that it helps a lot of kids and it helps the world with getting kids excited about science and about um and about the world around them so that i feel like that was a real contribution that i made to the world
5809,367,mhm,
5810,367,that sounds interesting,
5811,367,how did you decide to do that, oh it was part of you know it was part of my my job um it was it was a we were trying to come up with with new ideas uh for because we would put together videos and stuff to give you know to to schools and everything and they had done those before but we decided to do something really big you know and there was a lot of traveling and there was a lot of um and there was a lot to it and so it was probably the biggest project that the n_s_f had decided to do and so we just kind of produced it right that doesn't yeah
5812,367,awesome,
5813,367,tell me how you spend your ideal weekend, um i guess <grunt> i don't know <laughter> uh i don't know it's been a it's been a while since i've really thought about that i don't know would i go somewhere would i i i i don't know
5814,367,okay i think i have asked everything i need to,

5830,368,yeah,
5831,368,what did you study at school, uh i actually studied political science and i also studied economics um i'm a big kind of a political you know junkie you know to begin with so i naturally kinda fell in line with that kinda field of study
5832,368,are you still working in that, i was i was but i lost my job and you know that's kind of a bummer you know um i lost it's uh geez it's already been maybe a year and a half by now maybe two years and um you know the economy uh got bad and the budget cuts got bad and you know um i wish i was working there again uh
5833,368,yeah,
5834,368,it can be tough to find a good job these days,
5835,368,i love my job you could almost say it's virtually made for me what's your dream job, <laughter> well i um wanted to be a lawyer at one time i wanted to be a lawyer and i um and that's why i took political science and i took a double major in economics and uh the sad thing is the sad thing i i regret is i eh you know to get into law school you have to take this entrance exam called the lsats and i studied for it like really hardcore you know for about a year and i took the xxx test and like a idiot um i didn't feel right about the that day it was kind of an off day and you know it was like you know the big game at the superbowl you <y> you know i just um i don't <do> i don't feel like i did well and i canceled the test and so um you know i kinda regret that you know
5836,368,that sucks, <laughter> tell me about it
5837,368,do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing, um i'm not really shy at all i'm definitely not shy um but outgoing i mean not one of these people <peo> i'm not flamboyent you know um i i'll talk to people i don't mind talking to people i don't mind um meeting <mee> meeting people that's fine with me but it's not like i'm you know dying to to dying to meet anybody <laughter> you know <laughter>
5838,368,yeah,
5839,368,i see what you mean,
5840,368,sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax, i guess um these days uh you know i play guitar you know i taught myself how to play guitar um
5841,368,nice, uh yeah thank you thank you i you know i i should've i should actually be doing more of it but i also like to exercise um uh i'm on a diet right now but my diet's been terrible time the eating habits have been terrible but the exercise part is just great i love to exercise <exerci> i love to run that's one of my best things to do for stress is like run and like work out um i just wish that my eating habits were were in line uh or a little bit better you know
5842,368,okay, <sniffle>
5843,368,how are you at controlling your temper, um <sigh> my temper could be you know definitely improved uh a lot you know um you know a lotta times i i feel i'm one of these introvert types persons when it comes to like you know i don't mind being extrovert or like meeting people and like having a good time whatever when uh when i'm mad i really don't wanna be you know talking to people i don't like to yell i don't like to scream i don't like to hit i don't like to fight i kinda close down a lot i don't i just wanna be left alone sometimes i tend to drag it on for longer than it should be you know uh the wife doesn't like it too much and maybe i you know i just don't i just don't wanna talk about it <laughter> i just don't wanna deal with it i kinda close down and shut you know shut off for a little bit
5844,368,mhm,
5845,368,when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about, geez um you know it doesn't happen too often maybe with my wife you know we were probably something silly who knows who knows
5846,368,what's something you feel guilty about, um the thing i i mean i don't have a lotta guilt i don't do anything like to make me ever feel like you know that bad of a person you know um there are things that like you know um i call minor sins you know i get white lies or whatever you know but like nothing like so atrocious that makes me feel like guilty
5847,368,can you give me an example of that, um let's see i guess sometimes you know um you know i i'm a married guy but i you know sometimes there are times you know i like to you know smile at a girl or like you know get a girl's attention you know i don't know i never go i never do anything about it i never get their phone number or like you know but sometimes i like to like talk to people i guess you know
5848,368,mhm,
5849,368,tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently, well that's a good question i guess i guess you know see i always handle it the same there's not i don't ever wish to ever to ever change i i never wanna like handle things differently i always kinda i'm pretty comfortable the way i handle things and you know i think that um i could be a lot worse and like you know shouting and screaming and hitting and this and that and that's just not me um you know i think the best thing to do you know is kinda like get a lot of breathing room a lotta space and um i don't wish for that to change or to handle any of that differently i just don't basically know what else to do you know um and you know the last thing i wanna do is start talking about you know feelings or any of this you know that's the last thing i wanna do and so like i don't wish that i handle things like that differently in that way
5850,368,uh huh,
5851,368,tell me about your relationship with your family, well um you know i'm pretty happy with my family right now um you know if i'm married and we have a baby along the way which is kinda nice um we have some cats thank you thank you we have cats and a dog a weenie dog and um my mom i i love my mom dearly
5852,368,aw, um uh she has diabetes which you know she doesn't control you know she doesn't control it and like it like uh it affects her health and it always has me worried about her and like stressing out about her and and she could do so much to like prevent it and she doesn't and um you know i have a good relationship with my mom i i love her dear dearly and i actually have a good relationship with everybody i think i think i have a ton <to> ton of of family and friends um that get along with me pretty well actually you know
5853,368,that's so good to hear, yeah
5854,368,how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep, um <sigh> there are times well i mean it's pretty easy for me to go to sleep actually i i feel like you know i sleep like a baby um the only problem i have i think is i feel like um you know sometimes like you fall asleep and you have you you're just going to sleep and you kinda like jolt you know like you almost kinda like fall eh it's like a falling sensation or something like that and it doesn't happen eh that often but it happens and um but for the most time <ti> part um no i sleep like a rock i sleep really good
5855,368,that's good, <sniffle>
5856,368,how have you been feeling lately, well right now generally i've been feeling um worried and and anxious and um you know uh and tense and the reason why is 'cause i said my mom um right well at least today well i found out my mom something she didn't tell me the whole story and i'm kinda waiting 'til this is over so we can i can find out what's wrong with her but um you know i'm worried about her she's in the hospital <ho> she's in the doctors right now so that doesn't tell me anything good and um you know um trying to find a job so that has me worried too and you know the baby along the way so that has me worried so i feel like <sharp inhale> you know overwhelmed with a just a lotta like you know things to do and like and um a lot on my a lot on my plate and like a lot of it doesn't have anything to do with me but i have to handle it like you know so like i guess
5857,368,yeah,
5858,368,how do you cope with them, well um i keep myself distracted i keep myself busy i i feel like a busybody you know and the more um which kinda seems <se> you know seems like it's not a good thing because i feel like i'm just adding more things on my plate so um you know like one of the things i do is like exercise and so i have to work out every day you know but that takes an hour that takes an hour to like you know change <ch> change and you just start running and like go through the whole thing of stretching and and cooling down that takes it takes some time and then like to shower all that kinda stuff takes <ta> takes time so but i have to do it daily so i cope with it in that way i also cope with it too you know playing guitar but that just more of a distraction you know what i mean keeping you know keeping busy that way it just seems like it's not
5859,368,right, you know um working towards you know the goals you know that i need to do like you know finding <f> finding a job which i should be doing but then um you know it's one of those things where like i find like there's no good jobs i've been looking and looking and like sometimes when i do it it it's just not what i wanna do it just doesn't seem like <laughter> like i wanna like uh do any of these like terrible jobs
5860,368,mhm,
5861,368,that sounds really hard, i xxx it's you know it's it's probably harder than i'm thinking about it because sometimes i i i feel like um you know one of these things is like uh i feel like um it is hard but it's not i mean there are ways i can cope with it you know i just gotta kinda i kind of accepted it a lot you know i kinda internalized it and like uh you know it's not something that's like i'm not out on the streets or anything like that <laughter> but uh you know it is a worry
5862,368,yeah,
5863,368,have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d, i've never been diagnosed with p_t_s_d i used to work with
5864,368,have you been diagnosed with depression, no no <grumble>
5865,368,tell me about the last time you felt really happy, man <sigh> uh ten years ago <laughter> i don't know uh let's see the last time i was really happy maybe i mean nothing i feel like nothing makes me happy no more you know um i learned a new song on the guitar feel <fe> i i feel like not even happy about that you know i feel like um you know i work sometimes and that kinda makes me happy you know running like you know fast and working out but that doesn't make me so excited or anything like that it just makes me feel good you know so i i have these these these times where i'm just you know feeling good about myself and i'm feeling you know but i'm never feeling great i'm never feeling happy i'm never feeling like so sensationalized like you know and and and uh you know incredible that you know um it just eh you know there's these there's these mild times where there's a a few good times you know and a few bad times but the good times are no never <n> never <ne> never extremes you know never really good times and never really you know atrocious bad times you know
5866,368,uh huh,
5867,368,what are some things you wish you could change about yourself, well i wish this diet would work out a little bit better you know but that's kinda hard you know 'cause i'm the kinda guy who just likes who just likes you know um you know rice and and like uh mexican food and like <sharp inhale> you know um and to snack and uh i don't know um i just feel like that could i could change i wish i could change my eating habits that way i can like you know 'cause i work out so much i feel like i do so much running and so much activity that like um you know that if i got my you know diet in check um you know that that would um go a long way um i wish i also can change you know um my <m> my my uh i guess my my desire to like you know get ahead like right now i feel just so um like the economy's so bad and like things are so um rough that you know it's like pointless to even like you know look for these kinda jobs so like it just seems like i just wish i had a little bit more inspiration a lot more motivation to like to um <laughter> <sigh> do things
5868,368,yeah,
5869,368,i see what you mean, <sniffle>
5870,368,is there anything you regret, the one thing i regret is is not is not um you know is this this lsat thing you know um you know not uh uh canceling the test to begin with 'cause i'm sure i could've got into a a school but then again like you know it has me thinking like do i really wanna pay a bunch of like you know law school tuition and the cost of that and like you know just to um just to be piled on with more work and things like that eh
5871,368,right, i don't know <sigh> it just doesn't seem like like uh i mean there is a this idea of justice and and um and republicanism and you know things that i really you know adhere to that um i fall in love with and that i don't wanna get away from but it just seems like it's a like it's a ton of work and money and just to like um it for the smalls percentage of success that that you know you might not be really doing that kinda field you might you know i might <mi> it just doesn't seem like like um it's worth overcoming the obstacles i need to overcome
5872,368,yeah,
5873,368,what advice would you give to yourself ten or twenty years ago, ugh <sigh> i have no idea i would <laughter> i would <wou> twenty years ago i would tell myself maybe um you know i think i've done everything really well for myself except for the the lsat thing you know which i i you know regret on one hand on the other hand you know i i'm not sure if i regret 'cause like eh about the bills and all that kinda stuff i told you about and you know i think uh you know i i've waited to get married i waited to have a kid i've i've you know pretty cautious about the decisions <deci> you know i don't take drugs i don't drink i don't fight i don't do any of these like things that like you know that i think that real people have you know um and then they they really like you know ruin their life you know so like
5874,368,yeah, i'm pretty happy and content with being you know the cautious you know uh <sigh> i don't know
5875,368,okay,
5876,368,how would your best friend describe you, oh my best friend i think he he kinda like <li> he likes me he wishes that i would do more things with him but he works at night and and you know it's one of those things i think most people not just my best friend but my wife and might be but rest of my family feel that i don't put a lot of time and attention to them i mean they think that i'm pretty great when i do give 'em the my time of day and my attention but um i don't know if i'm really there all the time you know i don't know if i'm really you know i'm always thinking about something else i'm always thinking about something different i don't <don> i don't know if i really can give 'em eh a a real you know shoulder to cry on or you know if they ask for something you know i'll i'll usually do it you know but i almost feel like it's like a chore like you know like if they you know if they really need me then i'll do it you know eh if they're just asking for a favor i almost feel you know i do it half you know with a lotta lackluster lotta half-heartedness i just feel <f> and it's not because i hate 'em or anything i really like 'em it's just that i feel like i almost i don't wanna say i owe it to them but the mere fact that i'm their friend makes them somehow um you know uh like i eh it it makes me like you know they rely on me some you know times or like i don't wanna let 'em down they are my friends but it's the same time i i just feel like it's it's more it's not it's not it's more of like a chore to do instead of a a willingness like a oh my god like i just wanna help you it's never <ne> it's never like that it's just something that i do because i have <ha> kinda have to you know you gotta you know gotta do things for your friends you know in the end because they're your friends you know and i in in the end i do like 'em and they probably would do it for me and i you know so i just do these things you know just
5877,368,mm,
5878,368,what are you most proud of in your life, um well there are a couple a things that i do like uh that i've good <go> i feel good about myself you know um you know i ran the l_a marathon that kinda feels good you know i've graduated from college that kinda feels good you know what i mean but the thing is i don't feel like like that proud of myself for you know those things alone like graduating from college you know hasn't really made me successful you know what i mean um running the marathon hasn't made me thin and trim so they're like half merits you know or like they're they're great you know lotta people maybe not half done it a lotta people have excelled further but um you know they're kinda like stepping stones that like that um i've seal real new no life <l> lifelong benefit from doing other than the fact that i can say that i've done

5950,369,thanks for sharing your thoughts with me, thank you you're welcome <laughter>
5951,369,goodbye,
5952,370,hi i'm ellie thanks for coming in today i was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment i'm not a therapist but i'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you i'll ask a few questions to get us started and please feel free to tell me anything your answers are totally confidential are you ok with this, yeah
5953,370,okay,
5954,370,so how are you doing today, i'm doing pretty okay thanks for asking how are you
5955,370,that's good,
5956,370,i'm great thanks,
5957,370,where are you from originally, uh i'm from here in l_a i grew up in the san fernando valley
5958,370,really, yeah
5959,370,what are some things you really like about l_a, uh <sigh> well i i like the the diversity of people the different kinds of food you can eat i like um the outdoor opportunities i grew up close to the hills so i i did a lot of hiking um camping is pretty close by i've gone snowboarding um i like eh the familiarity i think and you know it's it's a big city and uh you know i'm pretty familiar with it having lived here for so long that that i i i would say i like that too
5960,370,cool,
5961,370,what are some things you don't really like about l_a, <laughter> probably the number one thing that everybody says i don't like traffic i don't like being stuck in traffic i don't like <deep breath> uh the long commutes even you know for short distances um and then you know it gets really hot in the summer at times so you know that eh i could stand it being a little <lit> slightly cooler when it gets to its peak peak heat but that's fine
5962,370,uh huh,
5963,370,i love my job you could almost say it's virtually made for me what's your dream job, wow my dream job uh <sigh> that's a great question i <laughter> i think my dream job would probably be uh you know maybe being able to travel and somehow make money off of it profit off it you know make gainful employment off of traveling but that's almost an unrealistic dream since i don't know if i would actually wanna do that but if if i had to pick some kind of dream existence you know traveling getting paid to travel meeting new people trying new things and being able to make a living out of that would be pretty fun
5964,370,what do you enjoy about traveling, well i like like i mentioned what i like about l_a i like trying different kinds of food different cuisines so i think trying authentic cuisines in different places and meeting different kinds of people seeing different ways of life uh would be eh is what i like about traveling um i i like experiencing new things um i think that would be nice you know despite the fact that i said i like the familiarity of l_a there's also fun in discovering new things so i i think travel <tr> when i travel that's that's what i like to do just check new things out um
5965,370,yeah, so i would like to be you know <laughter> if i could make a living doing that that would be great
5966,370,i'd love to hear about one of your trips, uh one of my trips okay well let's see the the last trip i i took um lemmi think of one <on> one one more exciting trip um well my my family is from eastern europe so one of the trips i took with my parents when i was fourteen was i i went to um austria hungary and romania and uh you know getting to see some of those old castles <ca> i'd been a few times before but i it was when i was little so i don't really have too much memory plus i didn't really process things quite the same as when i was kinda more of age
5967,370,yeah, so i got to see you know my family's old uh you know hometown you know uh we have a family um like tomb so i got to see that then just these old buildings and just the different way of life i i i really liked that uh you know seeing my parents old friends um you know and so that was pretty fun it was very different it was like really my first time being taken away from my my home environment you know i i left in the middle of the school year um so it was just like going from you know suburban america to traveling around kind of uh you know taking these old trains and seeing these castles and these old like hundreds of year old towns and it i i don't know if um it was for everyone you know i don't know <laughter> if it would be great for everybody but i i really enjoyed it
5968,370,awesome,
5969,370,sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax, uh that's that's a good question i do <sigh> uh i probably one of the things i do is either turn on like a rerun of a sitcom um i used to i i watch the office a lot so i kinda know when that's on so i'll i'll turn that on you know just uh kind of zone out a little bit to uh you know like familiar characters and and hearing jokes that are still funny for some reason or um maybe like uh eating some kinda comfort food you know i try not to eat too much fast food at all but uh like in n' out i really like going there so if i have to unwind um you know it's once every few months maybe i'll do that uh or i really like to read um especially like uh i'll read the day's events you know that that really relaxes me for some reason even if it's reading about something some conflict going on somewhere in the world i i still i'll read the headlines and i really like to know what's going on that kind of centers me um so i i really enjoy that that's something i do to relax
5970,370,uh huh,
5971,370,how are you at controlling your temper, i would say <sigh> i'm pretty great at it although i don't i think my nature makes it pretty uh easy <eas> makes that pretty easy i don't <laughter> i don't get very upset <up> upset um easily at all so i it's not much of a challenge to control my temper eh um yeah i don't <do> i don't really have anger issues i it's it's difficult for me to get angry uh so i don't i don't <laughter> i don't really have much trouble with that at all
5972,370,when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about, the last time i argued with somebody was probably <sigh> i don't even know i i i mean small disagreements you know i might've had uh with family or friends about things but just a full on argument i i i i can't even remember it's been years i i don't really argue too much i try to avoid conflict as much as possible in my my personal life i don't um really see anything to be gained by and i kind of uh naturally repel away from it so i don't sorry i don't <do> <laughter> i don't have much to say about arguing
5973,370,okay,
5974,370,what's something you feel guilty about, something i feel guilty about i would say that uh you know sometimes <somet> i eh <sigh> sometimes i don't really um i feel like i maybe haven't made the most of my potential yet in life i i think that i could definitely do more despite the fact that i work a lot um i i feel like i there's always more opportunities uh out there that that we're missing i feel like you know sometimes down time i feel a little bit guilty about that because there's always something that i could be doing that i'm not even if it's just putting away the laundry that that's been um i took out of the dryer that's been sitting there or running late i really don't like running late um although <sigh> it happens more than i'd like to i'd and i don't know why i feel guilty about that i don't like keeping people wait waiting because it makes it feel like uh you know my time is somehow more valuable than theirs which is obviously not true
5975,370,i see what you mean,
5976,370,tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory, um <sigh> hmm um nothing immediately comes to mind i well <sigh> the last car accident i got into i it was a few years ago i guess i i wish it hadn't have happened not that i wish i i've could erase it from my memory but i eh was um driving in rush hour traffic and you know i i thought the cars in front of me were were going um you know at least for a little you know ten fifteen feet but it turns out they had they had stopped so it was a <deep breath> you know xxx slow rear-end collision but it was still very unfortunate i was just uh you know it felt like i was paying attention one second and the next second you know i was just like reaching for something on the in the passenger seat and then i i smacked into the car in front of me and <deep breath> uh i i wish that hadn't've happened absolutely uh i know <kn> i know it's a minor thing but it was just really unfortunate the timing of it was very bad you know for me financially and the the people i got into an accident with were fine but i was <wa> you know they they you know didn't ask for anything beyond repairing the damages but uh it was just uh horrible timing um <deep breath> so i i wish that hadn't've happened
5977,370,yeah,
5978,370,that sucks, it does suck <laughter> it did suck i'm over it now but eh yeah it it does suck
5979,370,okay,
5980,370,how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep, well i'm a pretty good sleeper i although i i'm naturally wired to be up later at night so unfortunately my unfortunately my job um allows me affords me a pretty flexible schedule but at on the same token uh i wish i could <cou> were like hard-wired to go to sleep earlier because i just i wind up staying up 'til one or two every night uh and it's just too late you know even though i could get a full eight hours or whatnot of sleep it's not always at night time you know half my sleep is like in the kinda early daylight hours and i i wish i were more um able to sleep you know go to sleep at like ten or eleven
5981,370,mhm, and then sleep uh and then wake up earlier as opposed to going to sleep later and waking up later
5982,370,yeah,
5983,370,how have you been feeling lately, i've been pretty feeling pretty good i i've been i have no complaints physically and you know health-wise i feel good um you know my relationships with my my family and friends are good uh um everything is great so far i i have absolutely no no real complaints uh as far as how i'm feeling about myself or anything like that
5984,370,have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately, no no i've been fairly consistent with my behavior and my thoughts i think that um everything has been been pretty okay pretty steady no no nothing traumatic nothing um kinda resurfacing from the past nothing of the sort has has happened or is happening
5985,370,okay,
5986,370,have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d, no
5987,370,have you been diagnosed with depression, no
5988,370,is there anything you regret, well i think there's plenty of things everybody regrets uh yeah yeah there's there's plenty of things um <sigh> in my life uh yeah like i said i i do regret uh you know maybe not trying harder in my younger days you know i there's a period of time in my early twenties where i i didn't work for a while i just uh i hung out with a lot of friend you know i guess it was like the proverbial bad crowd you know none of us worked we just uh you know we we got high every day um or it seemed like every day i don't know it was just uh eh but it was a it was kinda like a throw-away period in my life
5989,370,what advice would you give to yourself ten or twenty years ago, i would say that um <sigh> it's important to to to engage with the world i think i i think i kinda dropped out from the world a little bit i think it's also i would say that it's important to um recognize the people around you for what they are you know and what <wha> what kinda potential you know future activities they you can expect from from the people you surround yourself with i think that uh i would say also that um kinda try to focus on what i wanted to do with my life as opposed to just thinking well you know things will work out which eventually they do but i i think that you know there's a bit of lost time with that um that approach it's kinda fatalistic and i i think that i would say you know um just try to concentrate you know you know not <no> not everyone works on the same schedule and life isn't a race but i would say that it was it's important to have a goal in mind or some kind of you know idea for what what you want out of life as opposed to just kinda waiting and um thinking that things will fall into place
5990,370,mm,
5991,370,that makes sense,
5992,370,tell me about a time when someone made you feel really badly about yourself, um <sigh> well i <sigh> i i guess when people i i don't especially um take even constructive criticism particularly well for some reason i i think that for <f> at least for myself i sort of have things figured out although i i i'm sure i'm wrong about that so i think just maybe in terms of like uh group work that i've done professionally or or academically you know when when some of my work is uh kinda picked apart or or scrutinized i don't <d> i don't deal well with that and i i take it more personally than i should
5993,370,when was the last time that happened, uh it was probably about a year and a half ago i was working on a research project at work and uh somebody with much less experience <exp> it was three of us working on something and then they brought it another pair of eyes just to go over it and it was somebody just out of uh college you know um went over what we had done and you know it was just kinda rewording things and it it seemed just like cosmetic changes that were being made just for the sake of of changing things and i kinda took personal offense to that just uh because i thought i had a lot more experience and more education and uh it it was unnecessary you know i i thought that the whole thing was a waste of time and you know i just um i i didn't think that she was somebody that was qualified to to necessarily redo all our work um or or even to uh not not to redo it but to to edit it or to uh <sigh> not <no> eh proofread i guess to to make any kind of you know qualitative changes i i just thought that it was a a really bad idea and and i i thought that i you know i i shouldn't have viewed it this way but i thought that the fact that they brought in somebody with almost no experience you know was kind of like a an affront to us who had worked on it on this project but you know it wasn't our call <sigh>
5994,370,yeah,
5995,370,what's one of your most memorable experiences, mm most memorable experiences um well i guess the <sigh> first thing that comes to mind is one of my um the first real trip i took by myself uh i i took the uh the amtrak to to new mexico and i was out there exploring things um for about ten days on my own uh so that was kind of the longest period of time up 'til that point and i was in my i was i don't know twenty three maybe at the time that i i'd really just been on my own completely cut off from everyone i was in parts of new mexico where there was no cell phone reception at the time um and it was very memorable because i was on it on my own i felt like i was really uh you know exposed to the things i wouldn't have seen if i had had traveling companions um and it was a lot of fun
5996,370,nice,
5997,370,tell me about the last time you felt really happy, uh well i've been very happy recently i for the i i'm getting married in a few months uh i got engaged on labor day uh in two thousand twelve thanks <laughter> so i i was uh that was a very happy day this this whole process you know of um of meeting someone and we
5998,370,aw, we kinda progressed very quickly realized where we recognized where we were um so i i've been a pretty happy state the past uh well it's been eleven months now but um yeah so i i think that the day we got engaged and then we we shared it with our family i think those have been very happy times um new years was happy you know uh i i'm in a happy period of my life right now so yeah
5999,370,that's so good to hear, yeah thank you <laughter>
6000,370,how would your best friend describe you, uh <sigh> with a <sigh> sort of um sense of humor that maybe not everybody gets i'd say uh also uh you know um helpful calm relaxed maybe uh <sigh> intelligent um you know likes to recycle i know that's so something that they would say uh
6001,370,(laughter, i what else i think that um my best friend might say that uh i i i like animals i've always had dogs and cats so they might describe me as a people person or i mean a an animal person excuse me i also um you know fairly easygoing you know flexible with with plans
6002,370,mhm,
6003,370,what are you most proud of in your life, mm uh i'd say one of <sigh> most proud of in my life um hmm <tisk> well <sigh> i i i'm pretty happy with the level of education i've gotten i'm also going back eh starting in the fall i'm starting a p_h_d program so i'm happy about that i'm happy about you know breaking some of my bad habits from the past i i'd say if i'm proud of anything it's that um you know i have a strong faith relationship i go to church often i'm i'm very happy about that i don't know if pride is the right word but um my relationships with my family and friends are all very good uh i'd say maybe the fact that it's a lot different than my life is a lot different than it was about ten years ago you know the the change i'm i'm happy and proud of that

6103,372,yeah,
6104,372,i see what you mean,
6105,372,i'm sure you can tell by my shoes i'm not much of a world explorer do you travel a lot, no not too much
6106,372,okay,
6107,372,what did you study at school, child development
6108,372,how did you decide to do that, well i have a son and i wanted to know how to be a a good mom and so i wanted to know about the stages uh that he would be going through
6109,372,mhm, eh and be able to relate better to him
6110,372,that's great, mhm
6111,372,are you happy you did that, i am
6112,372,are you still doing that, kind of i'm trying to get it started again in the fall
6113,372,i love my job you could almost say it's virtually made for me what's your dream job, i'd like to write
6114,372,nice,
6115,372,tell me about that, well um i've written some children's books and i've just been doing research looking into getting my books published it's only like two that i've written so far but they're pretty good i've gotten some good feedback on them from my critique groups
6116,372,what was it about, <laughter> it's about a little boy that's surrounded by people that are jerks and he tries to not become a jerk with them and <laughter> it puts him in like a really
6117,372,aw, scrubbed_entry he goes through a lot of moods dealing with the people in his life
6118,372,awesome, mhm
6119,372,do you find it easy to be a parent, um no i've had some issues some nervous breakdowns actually and right now my son is staying with his dad so <laughter> um no i'm a single mom it was the hardest thing i think in the world <laughter> is being a single mom <laughter>
6120,372,yeah, so
6121,372,how do you cope with them, how do i cope <deep breath>
6122,372,yeah, um <sigh> well right now um i didn't have very many good <goo> coping skills or mechanisms so that was the problem
6123,372,mm,
6124,372,what's the best thing about being a parent, it's so spontaneous like the stuff that comes outta kids' mouths sometimes and the stuff that they do and just brings a smile to your face
6125,372,can you give me an example of that, um well when my son was younger once we were just sitting around the house and he comes and he starts doing my hair and he says to me mom i want you to put on some lipstick and high heels and ponytails so you can go out and get married and find a boyfriend <laughter> so
6126,372,(laughter, yeah it's pretty spontaneous things like that happen that my kid's telling me i need to not be single anymore <laughter>
6127,372,okay,
6128,372,what's the hardest thing about being a parent, the hardest thing <sigh> not wanting to screw it up i feel a lot of stress and pressure that every little thing is gonna make <ma> make a difference and matter in what kind of person my kid turns out to be and so it's a lot of stress on yourself <laughter>
6129,372,that sounds really hard, yeah
6130,372,do you think that maybe you're being a little hard on yourself, yeah <laughter> definitely
6131,372,what are some ways that you're different as a parent than your parents, um hmm i think i'm different from my mom because i'm a little bit more tolerant of that spontaneous interaction i welcome it you know i welcome getting to know who my child is right now and not try to mold them into somebody that i want them to be but just see them become the best child that they can be the best adult that they can be without molding them in that direction necessarily
6132,372,yeah, into a different person <laughter>
6133,372,uh huh, so
6134,372,who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life, say it again
6135,372,who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life, who's someone that's a positive influence
6136,372,yeah, um <sigh> mm i don't really have anybody like that
6137,372,okay, okay
6138,372,sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax, well i've tried to meditate sometimes but i don't really stick with it often enough um i've tried to like go for walks but i don't always do that and i don't always stick with it <laughter> so
6139,372,uh huh, yeah that's about it
6140,372,how are you at controlling your temper, <sigh> i'd say i'm a little below average meaning that i get angry more than most people do i think
6141,372,when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about, hmm last night <laughter> but it was on the telephone i was arguing with my husband um we have my sister lives with us and she lives with us in a very small room with a small apartment i should say and she's got four people living in in one room so um it's kind of stressful it's really crowded and my husband is stressed out about it and you know i'm just saying to him that i told you so i told you if my sister moved in here then there was gonna be a mess in the house and she's gonna be asking for things you don't really wanna do that's just how my sister is <laughter> so the house is messy and it's crowded and every day they're asking for rides and my husband he's avoiding coming home because all these people are home and he doesn't wanna be there anymore and i'm just saying that he's gonna have to find a way to deal with it because he asked for it in my opinion <laughter> so <laughter> hmm
6142,372,that sucks, it does <laughter>
6143,372,tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently, oh i've got tons of 'em but right now what's on my mind is um losing custody of my son um right now like i've been arguing with my stepmom and my stepsister for a long time about my son and how they treat him and how i want him to be treated like they don't have any boundaries and i believe that boundaries are important establishing who's the adult who's the child they let my child boss 'em around and stuff anyways because of this they're gonna be testifying against me in the custody trial saying that
6144,372,oh no, yeah they're gonna be saying that i'm not a good mom because i believe in having boundaries and we have very different ideas about child raising she's my stepmom she's my dad's fifth wife and she's she really doesn't she's really far removed from how i was raised and i wanna raise my child more similar to how i was raised where you're we had some independence and we had some boundaries and we knew what the rules were and what was expected of us and with my stepmom she xxx no rules she has no expectation she just wants him to run wild and have everything that he wants and that's fine when you're a grandparent but the problem is that i live with them sometimes and when i'm in the same house with them they should be following my rules and not trying to go and break all of my rules <sigh> anyway <laughter>
6145,372,right,
6146,372,that makes sense, yeah
6147,372,how did you feel in that moment, um in that moment <sigh> just really frustrated because they don't listen to me i feel disrespected i feel like invisible i feel just angry that they're taking away my right to parent and it's something that i worked really hard to do i went to school and i studied child development i've read all the magazines and i've read the books and i'm really <laughter> i know what i'm talking about i feel confident in my parenting skills and my parenting abilities and to have these people that haven't done the same thing and worked as hard as i have to be a good parent try and tell me that i'm a bad parent it's really uh hard to believe so i feel very disrespected um unacknowledged angry frustrated all those things <laughter>
6148,372,yeah,
6149,372,i'm sorry,
6150,372,how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep, um i take i take benadryl to help me sleep and i'm so <laughter> my doctor gave me that <laughter> uh she gave me benadryl told me that i could take it to help me sleep and last night i was crying before i went to sleep so sometimes these thoughts start running through your head at night when you're in bed but i tried to push them out and then i got up and i took my benadryl so i could go to sleep more easily <laughter>
6151,372,hmm,
6152,372,are they triggered by something, yeah i'm always thinking about my son how i wish he was with me and how unfair everything is that's happening <sniffle> and like i don't deserve to have my son taken from me because i'm a really good mom you know <sobbing>
6153,372,yeah, and i'm too hard on myself so but i am a good mom and i feel confident that i'm a good mom i just i don't really have the money to take care of my son like my dad the son's dad does he has more money than me and right now i'm trying to be okay with it because i know he can do more for him financially than i could but that doesn't mean i'm not a good mom <laughter> hmm
6154,372,yeah,
6155,372,how have you been feeling lately, i'm pretty depressed i'm on anti-depressants um i take wellbutrin i been on them for a couple weeks now i think they're working i don't know i'm not as down as i was i mean i got here today i got dressed <laughter> i made it out and i'm here today so not that bad
6156,372,what got you to seek help, um <sigh> hmm my husband complains a lot he says i'm not the same person that i was when he married me he said i was fun and i was positive and i was all these other optimistic things that's another thing he was on the phone telling me last night and <sniffle> and i'm not those things anymore <laughter> which is true i mean we got married a year ago and then my son was taken shortly after and it was just such a shock and um i've just been trying to get back from it but it's been hard
6157,372,i understand,
6158,372,did you think you had a problem before you found out, did i think i had a problem before i found out found out what
6159,372,what were your symptoms, oh um yeah like crying a lot something like i cry all the time <sobbing and laughing> it doesn't take much for me to cry i'm just crying thinking about crying but like um my family would invite me to family events and i would go and just just cry because my son wasn't there <sniffle> or um i don't know it's just all the crying i think and like i said my husband letting me know that i'm not the same person so he's disappointed and i feel bad even that <crying and laughing> i'm not the same person that he he knew <crying and laughing> i feel bad about that too another thing i'm feeling bad about you know <crying>
6160,372,do you still go to therapy now, yes i do i try
6161,372,do you feel like therapy is useful, do i feel like the therapy's useful um yeah it's nice to talk about your problems i go in there and i cry every week so at least i have a set time every week where i can go in and cry <laughter> um that's i mean it's a release to be able to cry sometimes i feel better afterwards um
6162,372,that's good, yeah and she helps me make decisions you know help me to be more proactive in my life
6163,372,mhm,
6164,372,like what, um well i'm looking for jobs and things like that and she gives me ideas of why don't you work here or why don't you work there or have you thought about this or that you know and then she said something about why don't you go back to school and so i went and applied to go back to school you know i'm not doing much with my life and sitting around all day isn't helping my depression any either so i'm trying to find a work and i applied for college in the fall i got accepted to dominguez hills so i may be going back to school in the fall right now i'm still looking for work but she helps me with that kinda stuff just giving me ideas that life isn't over <laughter> that there's still more you know i could be doing
6165,372,that's good,
6166,372,right, with life life yeah
6167,372,tell me about the last time you felt really happy, everything's always bittersweet um i don't know last time i was really happy i don't know <laughter>
6168,372,tell me how you spend your ideal weekend, my ideal weekend oh i don't have a lot of money 'cause i'm not working right now so really my weekends are just spent reading maybe but i can't really i i can't pay much attention when i'm reading so <laughter> i have a short attention span i can only read a couple chapters <deep breath> um
6169,372,uh huh, but lately i say that's what i've been doing is reading
6170,372,tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed, something i've read xxx
6171,372,whatever comes to your mind, okay i like to go to u_s_c they have these nights where they have things like book signings or poetry and art it's called visions and voices so i like to go out to <t> to their events and i usually enjoy those
6172,372,awesome,
6173,372,when was the last time that happened, um about two weeks ago um deborah harkness was there doing a book signing for a discovery of witches and so like i said i'm trying to be a writer so i try to go especially to the book signings
6174,372,wow, and see what it's like to be an author who's talking to a crowd and signing books <laughter>
6175,372,mhm,
6176,372,what are you most proud of in your life, my son <laughter>
6177,372,how would your best friend describe you, i don't have any friends
6178,372,what would you say are some of your best qualities, my best qualities um <sigh> i'm smart i'm good-looking um i'm really um and like a hard worker i i'm dedicated to like self-improvement um that's all i can think of right now <laughter> okay
6179,372,okay i think i have asked everything i need to,
6180,372,thanks for sharing your thoughts with me, okay
6181,372,goodbye, goodbye press the buzzer now
6182,373,hi i'm ellie thanks for coming in today i was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment i'm not a therapist but i'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you i'll ask a few questions to get us started and please feel free to tell me anything your answers are totally confidential are you ok with this, yes
6183,373,okay,
6184,373,so how are you doing today, uh doing okay doing okay
6185,373,that's good,
6186,373,where are you from originally, uh north carolina
6187,373,really, yep
6188,373,when did you move to l_a, uh almost four years ago
6189,373,wow,
6190,373,why did you move to l_a, um i graduated college had an internship out here uh for a production company so i started doing that with a group of friends and then got work after that and enjoyed the city so much and have been working out here since
6191,373,cool, yep
6192,373,how often do you go back to your hometown, uh probably three <th> at the most three times a year maybe twice usually the holidays maybe one random trip in there
6193,373,that's good, mhm
6194,373,how does it compare to l_a, um uh it's l_a's only now just starting to become home to me in the sense of that respect where like uh going home was going home now going home's like going back to see my family and seeing some friends um but um i i feel more i feel more like i belong in los angeles than i do back at home
6195,373,uh huh,
6196,373,what are some things you really like about l_a, uh the food um the weather goes without saying uh i the <th> i like the resources there i like feeling um i like that uh the things that i wanna do uh are much easier much more accessible out here than they would be in north carolina so it i feel like i'm uh uh i'm able to uh pursue eh a lot of my passions ambitions in a much more functional and realistic way living in los angeles than i am in north carolina
6197,373,what are some things you don't really like about l_a, uh i mean the cost of living isn't great but at the same time too i always kind of tell people like part of the rent is having access to so much um resources <resour> so many resources out here so uh it's not even expensive as new york or boston so uh it's not the worst but um uh and also i mean it is a little bit annoying that every time i do wanna go home it's a flight not a drive i can't i mean conceivably <con> really conceivably drive home for the holidays 'cause it's about a three or four day adventure and just not practical so it's uh unfortunate that i'm so far away in that respect but i can't really change geography
6198,373,yeah,
6199,373,that sucks,
6200,373,what did you study at school, uh <laughter> <laughter> i studied uh history and uh media studies and production
6201,373,are you still working in that, uh yes i work as a freelance writer and producer
6202,373,how did you decide to do that, um in college i realized i was pretty good at it and uh i knew there was a way to monetize that and i came out here and uh worked a little bit uh in the uh public sector in trying to you know just doing those jobs that way and realized i could make more money have more control over my schedule and my life if i did it freelance so i've been doing it now for a little over a year now
6203,373,that's great,
6204,373,i'm sure you can tell by my shoes i'm not much of a world explorer do you travel a lot, i do um i love traveling i try to uh go somewhere new for a good period of time about every uh seven to eight months just try to mix up things so i was in barcelona just recently and i'm planning on going to um either vietnam or even back to europe in next couple months so
6205,373,awesome, mhm
6206,373,what do you enjoy about traveling, uh i enjoy the break from routine i think that uh while it's nice to wake up and kind of have a vague idea where your day's going uh after a few months you can get very much kinda caught up in that and you uh pigeonhole i guess your thought process your expectations for the day and i love going to a foreign country and just waking up and knowing that everything i do that day is gonna be brand new and will be different than what i would be doing if i was in los angeles or and um our own routine so i i'm a big fan of that and i love the food so it's great to just eat um a lot of food that i love in the places where they were originally created
6207,373,mhm,
6208,373,i'd love to hear about one of your trips, uh yeah sure i went to uh barcelona uh like i said a few uh months ago and that was mainly because i had a friend who was living there for uh six or seven months and she kept asking me to come out and uh i finally i was at a point <p> point in work where i'd been working so much for months on end that i felt like i deserved a break so i went there for two weeks and yeah it was one of the healthiest smartest things i've done in awhile so i mm reminded me again how uh how important it is for me at least to uh to travel and to get out of the world
6209,373,that's so good to hear,
6210,373,do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing, i'm very outgoing i uh love talking to people and conversing even virtual people oop i lost ya
6211,373,sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax, um to relax i uh listen and play music a lot i like to read uh i like to go see movies uh cook i cook a lot so i enjoy cooking um uh my <m> my girlfriend and i are uh currently separated by distance um so i haven't seen her in weeks and that can be very uh sad obviously so i'll talk with her as much as i can but uh but yeah just uh um uh pretty simple tastes
6212,373,okay, yep <participant is talking to rachel who has entered the room to fix a problem with ellie>
6213,373,(laughter, <laughter> this is awkward isn't
6214,373,how are you at controlling your temper, um i don't really have much of a temper so uh very good i guess i don't really get angry easily or quickly and uh when i do i'm usually aware of it enough that i can kinda formulate how i feel and why i'm feeling that way and what i want to be done about it so uh so it's pretty i guess i'm a pretty easygoing guy in that respect
6215,373,that's good,
6216,373,when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about, <sigh> uh honestly it was probably something petty over like uh misremembering when uh something was done or like a a date on something or like a a a fact probably wasn't anything emotionally fueled uh and it was just about yeah i think it was probably about like trying to figure out when exactly we went to san francisco and it wasn't even an argument as much as just the other person thinking the other person's misremembering so um in you know small or big situation it's very difficult for me to actually feel enraged uh i guess in the classical sense of the word
6217,373,okay,
6218,373,tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently, um <sigh> i'm trying to think i'm not one one for regrets um um i just recently did a uh uh a project like a a film and uh the subject matter had a little bit to do with like an ex-girlfriend of mine so when it came time to release it uh i made a point i to i didn't wanna send it to her directly 'cause i didn't want her to think that i was doing to xxx her face but i did send it to her brother just because he enjoys my work and always says he wants to see stuff and i um uh maybe that <tha> she might've could've misconstrued that as being passive-aggressive i don't know um but um but yeah i mean that's something i i thought about but i don't really regret it as much as like maybe i could've just let uh everyone <ever> everyone else who i wouldn't wasn't necessarily sure about if i should do stumble upon it as opposed to me directing it to them so just my thoughts there
6219,373,yeah,
6220,373,tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make, <sigh> <laughter> hardest decision i've ever had to make <deep breath> ah um <sigh> uh it was actually probably uh probably that uh ah i don't even wasn't even a hard decision with like i said with that the the same ex-girlfriend that i mentioned of it was probably hard because uh i knew i had to uh
6221,373,right, break up with her after some stuff happened and um it was difficult 'cause i cared about her a great deal but also same tune it wasn't hard to arrive at the conclusion that i had to uh to uh break up with her but at the same time too it was not uh uh the easiest thing to kinda go through that process it's getting on a rollercoaster that you're very much aware of how mm terrible or frightening it's gonna be but you know you have to get on the rollercoaster so uh so yeah i'd say that's probably of recent memory
6222,373,what made you decide to do that, ugh just a abundance of <laughter> reasons that uh this person was probably not the uh best person for me so uh like i said it was a it was i didn't have to uh i didn't have to weigh too much too much data to figure it out um it was pretty clear sign and i have no regrets about doing it now um i uh yeah i feel very strongly then about it and i felt i still feel very strongly that i made the right choice now
6223,373,okay,
6224,373,how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep, um <sigh> it can be it can be tough there be <b> they'll be i feel like it's either if i if i've exhausted myself during the day between work and you know i've i've started exercising again which is a huge help but um but i'd say that it's i kind of when i get into bed at night i never know how it's gonna go sometimes it's uh sometimes i'll wake up within an hour of falling asleep and i can't go back to sleep or um i'll just yeah periodically keep getting up and up um so it's something that's gotten a little better in the last few weeks but uh yeah um like i said especially having my uh my current girlfriend uh not around like i said she's a very big source of comfort around so like that uh um but she travels a lot for work so it's something to have to adjust to and uh uh sleep can be can some that suffers from that but uh in the same respect i'm not someone who actually i feel like i don't need too much sleep i if i can get if i can get four to six hours i'm in pretty good shape that day so
6225,373,how have you been feeling lately, um uh little anxious i guess uh little more <mo> more just um uh i just whenever i get off of a assignment uh there's always just the question like what am i what's going on next and uh so far i don't have the next um project lined up so it's always that nervousness um in the past something usually does come up so you have the precedent of it usually working out but until it does you're always a little um uh anxious and it can be depressing 'cause it's like uh um you know i've chosen a very much a lifestyle that while i get to have a lot of control and autonomy over my life uh it also is all on me in order to do it and you know sometimes i'm i um i'm very jealous of the idea of people just waking up going to an office for eight hours leaving and not having to think about that work the minute they leave the office and kind of having the momentum of a group of people or or company um carrying them through when um it's a little tough whereas like me if i have an off day or if i'm a sick day um that no work gets done <laughter> you know i'm a small business that has one employee
6226,373,uh huh,
6227,373,how do you cope with them, how do i cope with them um i assume you mean i guess uh people i work with how do i cope with the uh maybe the better answer would be how do i cope with that lifestyle and just i got much <m> uh much more used to it something i'm still learning and figuring out how to how to handle uh as far as not just like i know the the how rewarding the work is when i do it but it's also figuring out what's the most efficient way to live the life and you know how do i uh what's the appropriate way to budget finances what's the uh expectation i should have for myself in a given year what's realistic what's hopeful um and that's something that i'm sure will take years and years to do but i feel like as long as i'm getting better at it then uh it's progress right
6228,373,yeah,
6229,373,have you been diagnosed with depression, uh yes uh definitely once and then probably i if i would've gone back uh um i was gone in high school probably it would've been second time but um but yeah i've been diagnosed with depression once so i feel like it's one of those things that uh is something i have to keep in check throughout my entire life you know um i feel like i'm a pretty happy person for the most part but um uh has they i hate as annoying as it is but like they say like with people who are very creative or people who do a lot of stuff with the mind it tends to follow and i get that it's a self-esteem thing 'cause it's so hard to feel um so hard <har> or so easy i should <shou> suppose to get in your own head about that
6230,373,mhm,
6231,373,how long ago were you diagnosed, uh this was within a year so i probably was feeling uh symptoms having been there before it was kinda easy to figure out like ah you know it's kinda happening again so i feeling uh the symptoms again uh uh and going through those emotions and feeling like okay at first i was kinda hoping it would be something i could kind of work through myself but um i realized it was just stupid for me to try to fight the battle on my own so i went and um started seeing a therapist
6232,373,what were your symptoms, uh uh really bad this is when i i just couldn't sleep at all like i would get maybe an hour of sleep a night at best um i wasn't sleeping at all had just no <sigh> uh no no drive to do anything whether it was you know as simple as brushing my teeth or cleaning my apartment things like that and just being in the same time simultaneously being aware that it's like oh this is all in my head and it's not even like a a symptom so um uh yeah just a general just a general malaise that comes with depression
6233,373,do you still go to therapy now, uh no i just finished up uh finished up i mean since i didn't graduate or anything <anyth> like that but i got to a point where i felt like uh um i kind of talked through as much as i could talk through and i'd moved on eh in other places in my life it was in kind of a good good work xxx especially like i said i was i was working on something i really cared about um i'm now with someone i care about greatly and uh um there's such a potential opportunity for me to not even have to worry about the symptoms and stuff as much now that uh i felt like therapy was not necessary and also i just didn't really have the time to with as much work goes on so
6234,373,do you feel like therapy is useful, oh i definitely i think having someone you can confide in uh who isn't your friend or your family member who won't you know have a few drinks and tell someone what you said to them or anything like that is definitely a a something beneficial i can't imagine how anyone couldn't benefit from having that on a somewhat of a routine basis
6235,373,okay,
6236,373,tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory, um <sigh> i don't know i'm i'm a firm <f> kind of a firm believer that the all those things like those things that kinda can haunt you are also there for a reason like uh uh my sister died when i was uh about <bout> what twelve years old and she was younger than me and watching my parents like seeing my father cry for the first time was a very kind of traumatic thing for me and it uh i felt like i grew up a lot that day so it's um also difficult to see that and see how my parents had to deal with losing a child i don't want to forget those things 'cause i think they're very integral to um how i cope with life and how i perceive uh um hardships and obstacles and uh having that image of knowing my father on it's very very humanizing 'cause it's so easy to kind of you idolize your parents and i still idolize my father but to know he's he's a guy like me and as i get older it's um easier identify with uh the man he is
6237,373,yeah,
6238,373,what advice would you give to yourself ten or twenty years ago, <psh> so i'd be uh sixteen or six um uh i kind of like the notion uh that uh they're they always say you wouldn't worry as much what people thought about you if you realized how people how much people didn't think about you and that's really hard to tell a sixteen year old and i don't know what the point of telling a six year old but um but yeah i feel like especially when you're in high school until it gets i mean nowadays you <y> i mean we live in los angeles where so much is caught up in how people think about you and i still am very if i find out someone eh either is upset with me or doesn't like me it bothers me to a great deal or i hate letting people down so i would like to come to a healthier place where just knowing that sometimes you just can't really control how people feel about you even if you have the best intentions in the world so
6239,373,right,
6240,373,what would you say are some of your best qualities, uh i'm a very compassionate guy i um i'm there for my friends i'm pretty selfless in that respect i um have a good humor about things like even with <laughter> even with being depressed or depression i can joke about it it's not you know i'm not a morbid depressed more just the i'm aware of when i'm uh i'm low and uh i treat it as such and i don't you know i don't try to deny it i don't try to like any of that but i i i have a i'm a i'm a pretty like practical person in that respect i don't think uh even when i'm depressed i don't take it out on people or i don't think people people have told me they don't even seem to when i mention that <cough> been going through like depression no one seems to like or they don't mention i for one feel like when i do go through it it's like oh everyone can just tell and i'm just a smoking gun of sadness basically <laughter> but uh but no i i tend to carry it pretty well and uh um i don't i don't lose sight of uh the reality <rea> the reality of what i know is happening so
6241,373,uh huh, mm
6242,373,tell me about the last time you felt really happy, um i was on a my uh my girlfriend came uh she was in thailand for three weeks and then she was supposed to go to spain for two but she canceled that trip and came back and stayed with me for about ten days and um
6243,373,aw, yeah i know i <laughter> i love her she's great um she's the coolest person i know and so much fun and she uh when she's around she makes me so happy and uh um so having her for ten days and we just had like normal we we rarely get normal couples time like it's always like oh i see you for five days and then one of us has to go somewhere um so to have ten days just normal where we could just cook dinner at home like lie in bed and read books or anything like that was great and uh it makes me so happy that i have someone that i can do that with and just it feels so uh practical and feels so right
6244,373,that's so good to hear,
6245,373,how would your best friend describe you, um <sigh> i guess for xxx i'm i'm i'm a good guy like i i i know i don't uh i don't think i screw people over i don't um i'm a good friend to have i'm i'm there for people i look out for people i care uh about people and what they think of me and that goes especially much for my friends and i try to make sure you know with a lot of my friends being on the east coast i try to carve out time to make sure that they know i think about them and i call them and so i i feel like uh for a lot of people who count me as their friend i'm probably one of their better ones in just the sense that i'm i know how much i appreciate and respect uh the friendships we have
6246,373,mhm,
6247,373,okay i think i have asked everything i need to,
6248,373,thanks for sharing your thoughts with me, thanks ellie
6249,373,goodbye,
6250,374,hi i'm ellie thanks for coming in today i was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment i'm not a therapist but i'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you i'll ask a few questions to get us started and please feel free to tell me anything your answers are totally confidential are you ok with this, yes
6251,374,okay,
6252,374,so how are you doing today, pretty good
6253,374,that's good,
6254,374,where are you from originally, alexandria virginia
6255,374,really, mhm
6256,374,when did you move to l_a, uh i moved to l_a uh end of two thousand one
6257,374,that's a long time, yeah it's crazy <laughter>
6258,374,how often do you go back to your hometown, um a couple times a year usually like for holidays
6259,374,how does it compare to l_a, hmm <sigh> it is <sigh> it's very different um i think it's a lot more mellow um it's way more like suburbia it's nice um it there's something comforting about it but it's always like i get a little restless when i'm there and look forward to coming back here where there's a little more action <sniffle>
6260,374,mhm,
6261,374,why did you move to l_a, i went to um grad school at u_s_c
6262,374,cool,
6263,374,how easy was it for you to get used to living in l_a, um it was it wasn't bad i mean my my program that i was in was so intense that like for the first year it was so all consuming that i really didn't have much spare time to think about the adjustment it was just like i <laughter> my life was not my own so that made it kind of um easier i guess and also i was like in a community of people that i went to school with so automatically i knew people and you know made friends and stuff so it wasn't bad
6264,374,uh huh,
6265,374,what did you study at school, film
6266,374,how did you decide to do that, hmm <sigh> i uh had an epiphany one day um i was out of undergrad i was kinda floundering a little bit i didn't really know what i wanted to do and um just one day i kinda was like you know what am i really excited about what am i really passionate about and um i realized that movies <m> movies are the thing that i love the most and am most passionate about so that is how i decided to go to film school
6267,374,that's great,
6268,374,are you still doing that, um a little bit yes and no it's i don't i'm so <s> i'm like in a little bit of a transitional period right now but yeah like for the last several years i've been uh producing like freelance producer <sniffle>
6269,374,what's your dream job, <sigh> that is so the question of the moment <laughter> um i think that uh i don't necessarily have like a a job title that's my dream job but i knowit's sort of what um i want and 'cause basically like i've been living a freelance lifestyle for a while and i know that that is like exhausting and i don't wanna do that anymore so i'm looking for something that's stable um you know full time nice benefits and um i definitely wanna stay in the entertainment industry um and i like you know what i love about producing is that it's just like there's constant challenges and you sort of never know what is gonna get thrown at you that i that's you know it's always interesting and exciting um so i'm sort of trying to figure out right now what would be a good place for me to be where i can be reasonably challenged and you know have sort of a like room to to grow and advance and all that <sniffle>
6270,374,i understand,
6271,374,it can be tough to find a good job these days, yeah
6272,374,i'm sure you can tell by my shoes i'm not much of a world explorer do you travel a lot, <laughter> i can't see your shoes um i i like to travel um i don't know that i haven't really been doing it a lot lately but i have you know in the past done a fair amount
6273,374,what do you enjoy about traveling, um i love the adventure of it just you know new experiences new places new people um i think it's just good to sort of get out of your little insular world and see what's out there and just you know see beautiful remarkable places and just and things and just experience different ways of living and different languages and different cultures <sniffle>
6274,374,i'd love to hear about one of your trips, um let's see i went to costa rica a couple years ago um my like best friend from growing up she and i went for like ten days  and it was that's probably that might be like my favorite trip of all time <laughter> like it was really awesome but <laughter> costa rica is just like amazing and beautiful um and we just spent like we went to three different places and um just did a lot of exploring and like sightseeing we did a ton of hiking which was amazing and then like the last place where we ended up was this little beach town so by that point it was like we felt like you know we had done all this like amazing physical exertion like doing ziplines and all these hikes so that by the time we got to the beach it was like we've earned the right to just like kick back and relax and you know so it was just it kind of it hit all of the you know it like fed that sort of desire for adventure and activity um but it also i'm also a big fan of vacations where you just like veg out and relax and like lie on a beach with a book so it sort of hit everything
6275,374,awesome, <sniffle>
6276,374,sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax, <laughter> what do i do to relax um <sigh> i i mean depending where i am like if it's you know if i'm like at work or something and i'm stressed out i just will you know kinda take a minute and just like breathe really deeply and try to just calm myself down that way um if i'm home i might just like you know throw on a movie or like a t_v show that i really like and just that gives a sense of like sort of escape relief <sniffle>
6277,374,okay,
6278,374,how are you at controlling your temper, um pretty good i don't i mean eh it takes a lot to get me very angry it doesn't happen very often <sniffle>
6279,374,when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about, um the last time i argued with someone was <laughter> my mom and it was about money <laughter> <deep breath>
6280,374,how did you feel in that moment, um i felt really frustrated because i felt like she was like judging me unfairly and that was upsetting
6281,374,that sucks, yeah <laughter>
6282,374,tell me about your relationship with your family, um it's good uh you know they live across the country from me so i don't get to see them that often but like i usually talk to my mom on the phone probably like once a week and my parents are really supportive <sigh> um they are you know like when i go back home to visit like i enjoy <en> i enjoy hanging out with them we have a good time um so i'd say we have a pretty pretty good relationship
6283,374,that's good,
6284,374,what's something you feel guilty about, <deep breath> something i feel guilty about um <sigh> <makes sounds with mouth> i guess because i'm like in this sort of job hunting phase i feel guilty sometimes that i'm not like doing enough you know like there are times where like there are days where maybe like i should've sent out a few more resumes or done more stuff like i i feel guilty sometimes for not being like productive enough <sniffle>
6285,374,i see,
6286,374,how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep, <deep breath> um <sigh> usually it's pretty easy the last the last couple weeks like has been uncharacteristically like not as good
6287,374,why, i'm not really sure i haven't figured it out but um i've just had more uh like nights where it either takes me a really long time to go to sleep or i wake up in the middle of the night for no reason um i've also been having a lot of like really weird intense dreams that like i wake up sometimes i wake myself up sometimes <laughter> because i'm talking which is weird <laughter> um so yeah it's just i i don't know
6288,374,are they triggered by something, not that i have been able to identify i mean i guess maybe i'm like more stressed than usual just 'cause like i my job situation is like in flux but i i don't know there was no like event <sniffle>
6289,374,what are you like when you don't sleep well, cranky <laughter> i value good sleep <laughter> and i'm so i'm used to it so it's just yeah it's not a good feeling <sniffle>
6290,374,i understand,
6291,374,have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately, um not really no
6292,374,have you been diagnosed with depression, yes
6293,374,how long ago were you diagnosed, <deep breath> um <sigh> like <sigh> i think in like october or november although this is actually it's the second time it's happened in my life but the first time was like many many years ago <sniffle>
6294,374,what got you to seek help, um i felt like i was a really low and like too low for me to get myself out of it <sniffle>
6295,374,what were your symptoms, um <sigh> just having a hard time functioning on the most basic level like just getting up and taking a shower and like going to the grocery store and you know answering emails was just like it took so much energy um so yeah i just i wasn't  really functioning normally
6296,374,that sounds really hard,  yeah
6297,374,do you still go to therapy now, yes
6298,374,do you feel like therapy is useful, yes um <laughter> sometimes more than others but yeah overall i would say so
6299,374,what sort of changes have you noticed since you've been going to therapy, <deep breath> i think that therapy is good for me because it helps me focus on my sort of patterns um and also like ah just like observing how i am like responding to certain situations and just it i guess it's <deep breath> it gives me a more heightened like kind of self-awareness um so that as opposed to just like um kind of just reacting to situations i'm like mm just like noticing more what is going on um and it just helps to um i don't know it's just helpful <laughter> i don't really <real> i don't really know how to explain it <laughter>
6300,374,okay,
6301,374,tell me about the last time you felt really happy, <deep breath> <sigh> hmm <sigh> um i don't know um i <laughter> it's <laughter> probably not good that i can't think of <laughter> i can't think of anything <sharp inhale> um eh maybe over uh over christmas being at home with my family
6302,374,can you tell me about that, yeah um well it just was that was like i was kind of like just starting to come out of my depression then and um like you know i live alone here i have i have a dog but so i just had a long period of feeling not <laughter> great and just sort of doing it all on my own and kinda wishing that my family was around me um so when i was there with them it just um it just felt very like safe and comfortable and that just sort of like you know warm familial embrace
6303,374,aw, <laughter>
6304,374,that's so good to hear, <laughter>
6305,374,how would your best friend describe you, um <sigh> <laughter> i think she would describe me as funny and smart and um a good listener nonjudgmental um i don't know <laughter> is that enough <laughter>
6306,374,okay,
6307,374,tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory, <deep breath> hmm <sigh> okay um so this happened the the last like job that i had i mean i was it wasn't technically i was a freelancer but i was working for this company for like a year and a half close to two years and uh i had a it very small company the boss <bo> had a really good relationship with my boss um and he sort of <clears throat> he sort of out of nowhere uh mm told me that he was like downsizing basically and um essentially like the arrangement that we had is that he paid me like a monthly retainer for my services and then on top of that i would get paid fees per project so he like sat me down on this conversation and was like you know our major client that is like you know the bread and butter of the company they're the they're really cutting back like you probably notice things are getting really slow and i was like yeah and he's like so i'm gonna <onna> i'm gonna <onna> have to stop paying you your retainer and this was a total surprise but i was just like okay and he went on to talk about how he i would still have the right of first refusal of all the projects that came through the door and you know because of that he made it seem like you know even though i wouldn't be getting the retainer anymore he would throw enough work at me still that like i wouldn't you know it wouldn't be like a dramatic decrease in the amount of money that i was making <cough> excuse me but um and he was like you know this has nothing to do with the quality of your work i love working with you you're fantastic yada yada so to make a long story short what ended up happening is he was firing me um and he that was his way of basically like phasing me out of the company and letting me go because from that point he stopped calling me he stopped emailing me and later on like a couple of months down the road i um i had to go back into the office because there were a couple projects that were still ongoing like the client took a really long time to get back with their notes and when i was in there i saw that um this guy who had worked with us a bunch kind of like if we needed another producer like if we were slammed we would bring him on to do sort of additional stuff he was doing my job so
6308,374,oh no, yeah so it just like it was a really <rea> <laughter> it was a really shitty way to be like fired without being told that i was fired um and it was just like that uh the reason i would like i if i could i would erase that from my mind is because i can't really think of another situation that made me feel so like angry and frustrated and just like in a way that's like that still even though this was like you know several months ago feels very unresolved and still makes me kinda like angry when i think about it so yeah that was a very long explanation but that's what i wish <laughter>
6309,374,yeah,
6310,374,i'm sorry,
6311,374,what would you say are some of your best qualities, <deep breath> um <sigh> let's see i um a very loyal person <deep breath> um i am smart i'm organized i <deep breath> um very like caring kind um i'm conscientious and i work hard <sniffle>
6312,374,that's great,
6313,374,what advice would you give to yourself ten or twenty years ago, <laughter> uh man i think to uh be more confident and less passive um to really like focus on what i want and the things that i know will make me happy and to just go out and get them as opposed to sitting back and waiting for opportunities to present themselves <sniffle>
6314,374,mm,
6315,374,what are you most proud of in your life, hmm <sigh> um probably just some of the relationships that i formed with people um just like really you know deep friendships
6316,374,okay i think i have asked everything i need to,

6346,375,tell me about your relationship with your family, it's good but sometimes they're just they're too caught up in what they're doing to pay attention to other people's feelings
6347,375,can you give me an example of that, like with my brother he's just he's just tense because of his situation and he tried to brush <br> brush it off on me

6388,376,okay,
6389,376,so how are you doing today, i'm doing okay it's still morning so
6390,376,where are you from originally, i'm from the east coast massachusetts
6391,376,really, yes
6392,376,when did you move to l_a, um i moved to l_a when i was a child with my parents pretty much didn't have any choice in the matter <laughter>
6393,376,how often do you go back to your hometown, um i haven't been back there the last time i was back there was uh three years ago for christmas
6394,376,how does it compare to l_a, um l_a's very hustle and bustle there's a lot of people that are angry and a lot of people don't care about the other person here in l_a in which back east the east coast the the thought pattern is a lot different you know your neighbors you're friendly to your neighbors and to anybody that you see in the street
6395,376,uh huh, so the
6396,376,i see what you mean, yeah
6397,376,how easy was it for you to get used to living in l_a, um well since i was a kid i was fairly young at first it was rough i was getting in trouble a little bit in school but uh after all that surpassed i was <wa> i did fine in high shcool and stuff and even took some college courses
6398,376,that's good,
6399,376,what are some things you really like about l_a, um well i love the beach and i love the mountains i like to go hiking um and i like walking along the beach i just live a few blocks away from the beach so it's easy
6400,376,nice,
6401,376,i'm sure you can tell by my shoes i'm not much of a world explorer do you travel a lot, no not at all
6402,376,why, um just not interested uh i've been to mexico a couple times when i was younger went to ensenada but other than that i'm i'm not interested in leaving the united states especially with what's been going on lately um overseas
6403,376,okay,
6404,376,what did you study at school, um <laughter> actually child psychology and i was in the nursing program for a little bit but i had some problems at home which caused me to drop out <sniffle>
6405,376,i'm sorry to hear that, oh that's alright
6406,376,i love my job you could almost say it's virtually made for me what's your dream job, gah um i don't have one to be honest um i admire people that are doing the job that they love i mean like football players they love playing football and they get paid all that money how great is that <laughter>
6407,376,mhm, so
6408,376,do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing, um i'm pretty outgoing when i meet somebody at first i might be a little bit reserved because we all when we meet somebody pass judgment um as to if we wanna continue communicating with the person or not and but once i've decided that i like that person or whatever i i talk a lot so
6409,376,sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax, yes um i like watching movies i like i used to like reading but lately my concentration level hasn't been so great so it's hard to get into a good book
6410,376,how are you at controlling your temper, um not good at times i uh i have a some outburst every once in awhile so <s> eh it depends on how angry i get
6411,376,when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about, uh yesterday and it was with my partner and um actually to be honest i don't remember what it was about it's just sometimes people can have an ugly attitude and i don't appreciate that and if i feel that i'm being disrespected or whichever i'm gonna stand up for myself
6412,376,yeah,
6413,376,has that gotten you in trouble, so um at times some people may be turned off for my personality because very opinionated and i say what i'm what's on my mind um i do not purposely go and hurt people's feelings or anything of that nature but i won't be bullied and i won't be made i won't back down if i feel like i'm being challenged so
6414,376,okay,
6415,376,tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently, um uh last year my mother died so i wish i handled that differently
6416,376,is it uncomfortable for you to talk about this, um it upsets <ups> it's upsets me so
6417,376,i'm sorry, it's okay
6418,376,tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make, um let me see <deep breath> uh <sigh> i think i'm gonna pass on that one too because that'll upset me more so <laughter>
6419,376,okay, <sniffle>
6420,376,how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep, that is terrible um sometime uh sometimes actually falling asleep may not be a problem especially you know when you're done working and doing everything that you had to do in a day you're tired
6421,376,yeah, but staying asleep is a whole different thing for me because it's like i can't uh i get up and then i'm i'm wide awake i'll go out in the living room turn on the t_v and watch t_v i'm lucky if i get three to four hours sleep
6422,376,are they triggered by something, um maybe because i do have a lot on my mind uh you know thinking about bills and and the stressfulness of work and and then all this other stuff so that's probably a big burst part of it
6423,376,that sounds really hard, uh it's it's not difficult it's just frustrating 'cause when your mind goes on overtime mode it eh just affects everything your concentration your sleep your eating everything so
6424,376,uh huh,
6425,376,what are you like when you don't sleep well, i'm a little grouchy especially in the morning i'm not a morning person <laughter> i like the nights but i don't like the morning it's like leave me alone until i get my first cup of coffee
6426,376,(laughter, yeah so other than that i'm i'm okay
6427,376,how have you been feeling lately, um well i've been i've been depressed for quite some time and i'm still having difficulty <diff> difficulty uh 'cause after my mother died four months later my uncle died so i had two deaths last year so i'm still reeling and trying to get myself back together i'm i just recently i've started pursuing like interests that i used to do that i haven't done in a year because of what happened
6428,376,that's good,
6429,376,that's good,
6430,376,have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately, um i just i might get angry a little easier i sleep a lot i eat i overeat um i get tired very easily 'cause i'm not getting much sleep so sometimes it's hard it seems like i'm struggling to get through the day
6431,376,i see,
6432,376,have you been diagnosed with depression, yes i have a uh psychiatrist that prescribes me medication on a regular basis
6433,376,how long ago were you diagnosed, oh i was diagnosed quite some time ago um probably ten to fifteen years ago and it's just something i've never gotten over i don't know whether or not you can so i've always taken the medicine
6434,376,what got you to seek help, um i was arguing with everybody my family my friends and stuff like that and i was feeling desperate and hopeless and i had attempted to uh take my own life years ago which caused me to be hospitalized and then uh they started treating me i started seeing a therapist so
6435,376,is going to a therapist helping you, um well right now i'm not going to a therapist because my insurance they'll cover the psychiatrist and not the therapist but i am working with a friend of mine who has <ha> knows some avenues to go to seek <se> seek help for a therapist and i don't know if that's really gonna help me i mean sometime <someti> it depends on what kinda therapist you get sometimes people just sit there and they just listen to you talk and ramble on and you're thinking my god what good is this and the other type is the type that will give you some kinda feedback as to how to deal with the emotions tools to help you deal with your emotions
6436,376,yeah, so
6437,376,i understand,
6438,376,what sort of changes have you noticed since you've been going to therapy, um like i said i haven't been going to therapy recently just psychiatrist just medication um there's been no changes really i i probably would be doing fine because i was doing great before my mom passed away i was her caregiver and uh even though a lot of times i feeled i felt overwhelmed or lacked <l> uh lacked patience with her uh i still was a heck of a lot happier than i am now so
6439,376,okay,
6440,376,tell me about the last time you felt really happy, um uh <sigh> i would say when my son was born years ago
6441,376,do you find it easy to be a parent, i'm not a parent anymore he passed away so um and that was difficult as well
6442,376,i'm sorry to hear that, uh
6443,376,what would you say are some of your best qualities, hmm um i'm extremely organized extremely reliable my work loves me because i get everything done that i'm supposed to get done even though sometimes i feel a little scatterbrained and um you know those qualities are are admirable in people that can keep their word and and be responsible
6444,376,that's great,
6445,376,is there anything you regret, excuse me
6446,376,is there anything you regret, oh i have lots of regrets um uh things that i've done in the past that i'm not too happy about but um you know i met somebody once in my life that had had that saying and you see it on a bumper sticker uh live to never regret so you know you can't go back and make changes it's too late so why you know dwell on the situation but sometimes <so> sometimes it's a lot easier said than done
6447,376,right,
6448,376,what advice would you give to yourself ten or twenty years ago, um i'm not the advice kinda get person <laughter> i i you know i don't really give my friends any kind of advice i mean i find most of the times people don't listen to you anyway so why bother um i just state my opinion that's all
6449,376,what are some things you wish you could change about yourself, um well right now i'm on a diet because of my overeating after my mom died i was a lot thinner when she was alive i just went crazy with the food and sleeping a lot you know sleep eat sleep eat and so now i'm kinda like on a diet trying to lose this weight 'cause it's very unhealthy for me
6450,376,uh huh,
6451,376,tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed, um hmm trying to think it's been a long time actually there's really nothing because now i just keep my mind busy i haven't been to a movie in ages i don't i used to go out shopping all the time i don't now um so it's been it uh it's been quite some time since i've been content and happy with who i am and what i'm doing in my life right now

6473,377,how does it compare to l_a, <laughter> well my hometown is uh all of five thousand people  and um there are a lot of cows and barns and farms so the opposite of l_a <laughter>
6474,377,(laughter,
6475,377,(laughter,
6476,377,why did you move to l_a,
6477,377,why did you move to l_a, um <sigh> it's a good question i i've always wanted to live in california so but i had been living in in the central coast um and i just had been coming down to l_a like once a month for different business and networking and personal development stuff so um yeah things were were changing in santa cruz for me the client i had who was really the main like financial um main financial source i had that relationship ended so i was totally free to move and i thought well i guess i'll give l_a a try and see what happens so
6478,377,uh huh, so i gave it a shot and here i am
6479,377,how easy was it for you to get used to living in l_a,
6480,377,how easy was it for you to get used to living in l_a, oh not at all <laughter> it's a very very big city um i lived in dublin in ireland it was a which is also a big city but you know european cities are much more condensed and the public transportation is much more easy um and yeah so just getting around here and getting familiar with the city was pretty challenging and uh yeah so
6481,377,yeah,
6482,377,yeah,
6483,377,i see what you mean,
6484,377,i'm sure you can tell by my shoes i'm not much of a world explorer do you travel a lot,

6487,377,i'd love to hear about one of your trips,
6488,377,i'd love to hear about one of your trips, um sure well i guess hmm i'm trying to think which was my favorite i mean eh there was amazing things about morocco and costa rica both but morocco was incredible it was like twelve days and we went to three different locations we went up in the atlas mountains which are beautiful and uh yeah it's a really really cool culture so it was fun
6489,377,what's one of your most memorable experiences,
6490,377,what's one of your most memorable experiences, um <sigh> my trip to ireland i actually visited there which is why i decided to move there so my most memorable moment of that trip i mean there's probably dozens but the first most memorable moment of that trip was um being on a bus and and leaving um dublin and going just out to the countryside and seeing how absolutely breathtakingly beautiful it is i mean it's everyone sees pictures of ireland or you know you see it in films and it's green and lush and gorgeous but when you actually get there and experience it it's it like the pictures don't do it justice so it was incredible
6491,377,awesome,
6492,377,awesome, yeah
6493,377,what did you study at school, um i have an undergrad degree in english and psychology and a psychology minor and i have a master's degree in women studies

6495,377,are you still working in that, no i use my english and psychology um i work in marketing communications so i actually do sales so um yeah the psychology definitely comes into comes into play and eh so does my i guess my undergrad degree in english but really like i took that on and and created something out of it because most people who get an english degree just teach and i i wasn't wanting to teach
6496,377,yeah,
6497,377,yeah,
6498,377,what made you decide to do that,
6499,377,what made you decide to do that, um to guess i'm not clear on the question um
6500,377,let's come back to that later,
6501,377,let's come back to that later, okay
6502,377,i love my job you could almost say it's virtually made for me what's your dream job, <laughter> wow um <sigh> you know my dream job is being a a motivational speaker and trainer and coach um and traveling the world doing that and and impacting people's lives and um really contributing to people
6503,377,okay,
6504,377,okay,
6505,377,tell me about your relationship with your family, um my relationship's pretty good actually i i just repaired my relationship with my biological mother who would not she was sporadic i saw her sporadically growing up i lived my dad raised me and then he married my stepmom and um they had two kids together so i grew up and i consider them like the family i grew up with so but i got  in communication with my biological mother um last may and we've been we've you know cleared things up and have been in communication since then so
6506,377,that's good,
6507,377,that's good,
6508,377,how did you feel in that moment,
6509,377,how did you feel in that moment, um <mutters> well not sure which moment you mean but if you're referring to being in communication with my birth mother um i mean it was very freeing to just let go of the past and let the past be the past and create something new in the future and eh not just the future but in the present moment with her so yeah
6510,377,mhm,
6511,377,do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing, i'm shy
6512,377,sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax,
6513,377,sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax, <laughter> <laughter> um to relax i do a number of things i like to do yoga although i don't have the money for it right now um i love to dance i love to read i love to go to the ocean spend time just staring at the waves and soaking up all those negative ions that really recharges my battery actually probably more than anything else um i like to be with friends um i love art and trying new restaurants um yeah all those things are both relaxing eh i guess they're relaxing in the sense that um i feel connected to the people in my life and to the experiences of my life so
6514,377,uh huh, yeah yeah
6515,377,how are you at controlling your temper,
6516,377,how are you at controlling your temper, um depends if i'm driving not very good but otherwise i'm pretty good at it <laughter>
6517,377,when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about,
6518,377,when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about, um <sigh> last time i argued with somebody probably would have to be oh no it was with the l_a times about the newspaper delivery yeah that was the last time so
6519,377,can you tell me about that, yeah the <sigh> um the newspaper that was supposed to show up for the elderly lady that i take care of uh it didn't show up and uh i didn't realize that it wasn't there until um late i don't know afternoon i think early afternoon and then i called them and they said they couldn't send a replacement because it was after ten thirty in the morning which was absurd to me when they made the mistake in the first place so i mean for a service that you know we pay for for every day so um yeah it was i was really irratated and then i found out that the newspaper had been forwarded to a new address and that had not been communicated with me so i was angry with the l_a times i was angry with the people who'd forwarded the newspaper and didn't tell me yeah i was pretty frustrated
6520,377,yeah,
6521,377,tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently, oh wow there are quite a few of those <sigh> um let me think about one um the other day i had a phone call and i'm in a coaching program and it was from <sigh> one of the coaches in the program and she was um explaining to me that there was an additional call that was going to be we have meetings every week classroom meetings and then we also have coaching calls 'cause we have one particular coach we work with and then she called to tell me that i was going to have another coaching call with um someone who's not my coach and uh that hadn't been explained to me as part of the program so it in that moment it just seemed to me like oh my god i have all these people i have to be accountable to and i'm like eh you know i have to not just be accountable to them but share private things that are happening in my life with these people and it just was i don't know so yeah i wasn't um i wasn't angry i was just i just felt frustrated and a little overwhelmed in that moment and it you know and i talked it out with her and we got through it but um yeah i could've certainly just um been okay with whatever was being asked of me in the at that time and would've made the call go a lot smoother
6522,377,uh huh,
6523,377,tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make,
6524,377,tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make, hmm the hardest decision wow there's been a few i guess moving to ireland was probably the hardest decision no it wasn't even the hardest decision it was such an easy decision actually but telling my family about it was challenging um that but the hardest decision was my the first time that i moved uh away from my family i was twenty eight and i decided to i chose to move to colorado and um that was a pretty tough decision 'cause at that point my family had been you know within an hour's drive of wherever i lived an hour hour and a half and now they were gonna be you know um a twelve hour drive away or a plane ride away so that was it was challenging
6525,377,what made you decide to do that,
6526,377,what made you decide to do that, oh lots of things um i loved colorado colorado is a beautiful beautiful state and the weather is so much better than wisconsin and um at the time i was very much into rock climbing and there's just a huge outdoor <outdoo> outdoor community in colorado so there were a lot more people who were um in my age group and or single that was another factor um and were interested in the things i was interested in so colorado just seemed like a really natural fit so yeah and then i i found a a job that i liked the pay was atrocious but um i found some work that was really rewarding and so it all came together and i chose to move
6527,377,that sounds like a great situation,
6528,377,that sounds like a great situation, yeah
6529,377,how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep, uh that was totally unrelated question um <sigh> relatively easily it just depends on like what time i go to sleep if i'm out and i don't get home until eleven thirty then you know then i go to bed late and uh i wake up feeling tired like i feel today but generally i can sleep through the night i've had some pretty anxiety-ridden dreams the last couple of weeks um but even so even when i wake up from those or if i you know stir from those i still can fall back to sleep relatively easily
6530,377,are they triggered by something, um yeah i'm sure they are i mean i'm in another transition state i'm moving out of out of the <sigh> house that i live in right now where i take care of an elderly woman <sigh> um yeah and i just i have to find the financial means to support me in doing that and it's and she creates a lot of anxiety just in her state of being she's exhausting and utterly depressing so yeah
6531,377,how hard is that,
6532,377,how hard is that, um living with her is pretty hard like it's probably the hardest thing i've ever done and i would never ever choose to do it again if i honestly if i knew what i was getting into i don't think i would've said yes to the situation
6533,377,i see,
6534,377,how have you been feeling lately,
6535,377,how have you been feeling lately, um i feel trapped and helpless like there's you know nothing i can there's no way out of the situation that i'm in no matter what i do it doesn't get any better i don't <d> i don't i know i'm not getting any kind of work that i want to do and mm my money's not working at all so yeah it feels pretty crappy
6536,377,i'm sorry,
6537,377,i'm sorry, <laughter> thanks

6547,377,do you feel like therapy is useful,
6548,377,do you feel like therapy is useful, yeah i mean depending on the therapist and depending on your intention like i i don't go into therapy thinking oh i'm gonna be in this therapeutic relationship for the next ten years i think that's ridiculous
6549,377,right, i think you go into therapy to um work on a specific problem and have a solution and have somebody be your sounding board who can see things that you can't see and you know work through that situation and come up with um a strategy for not just that not just creating a solution in that area but also just creating strategies and uh tools for the rest of your life so that you don't have to be in therapy forever

6574,378,that's a long time, yep
6575,378,how often do you go back to your hometown, not too often maybe once a year sometimes less
6576,378,how does it compare to l_a, oh i love living in l_a i don't ever wanna live anywhere else
6577,378,why did you move to l_a, well i came out here to go to college and i wanted to be far away from my parents and the weather was good and that's part of it
6578,378,okay,
6579,378,how easy was it for you to get used to living in l_a, uh very easy well maybe somewhat easy the beginning the first few weeks was really hard to just be in a new environment and to be away from everybody i knew but after a few weeks it was great
6580,378,mhm,
6581,378,what did you study at school, broadcast journalism
6582,378,that sounds interesting,
6583,378,how did you decide to do that, well it's something i'd wanted to do since i was twelve and everything i did from the time i was twelve until i went to college was sort of in pursuit of that dream
6584,378,are you still working in that, no <laughter>
6585,378,why, well it's kind of a long story but i got laid off from my first job when i was in my twenties and it just once i had done that work i realized that's not really what i wanted to do it was too cut-throat of a business and it just really wasn't suited for me it didn't make me happy
6586,378,yeah,
6587,378,it can be tough to find a good job these days, yep <sigh>
6588,378,what's your dream job, my dream job is working with football players and helping them recover from concussions and other injuries
6589,378,nice,
6590,378,how hard is that, <deep breath> well the work itself is not very hard i'm very good at what i do the hard part is finding the right people and making the connections to work with them
6591,378,i see what you mean, it
6592,378,i'm sure you can tell by my shoes i'm not much of a world explorer do you travel a lot, i used to i don't travel so much right now
6593,378,what do you enjoy about traveling, i love seeing different places and different things like i love going to places that are not like where i'm from
6594,378,uh huh,
6595,378,i'd love to hear about one of your trips, my favorite trip is i went to australia for my thirtieth birthday
6596,378,wow, 'cause i wanted to lose my thirtieth birthday as i crossed the international date line
6597,378,(laughter, and i went to this really small <sigh> place up on the uh west coast of australia called shark's bay where native dolphins live and swim and is very isolated for the most part and i got to be there for a whole week and just really just pretty much by myself with all these wild dolphins and they come and they swim with you and it's amazing just a beautiful beautiful spot in the world
6598,378,awesome,
6599,378,do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing, more shy <sigh>
6600,378,why, <deep breath> why <sigh> hmm that's a good question um partly the first thing i think of is 'cause i've always been that way but maybe that's an excuse i don't know um <deep breath> i just prefer to be quiet and i'd rather be with fewer people than lots of people so <sigh>
6601,378,okay,
6602,378,sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax, <deep breath> i watch t_v <sigh> a lot or that's probably not the best alternative but it is something i do and i also walk on the beach 'cause i live close to the beach so that's one of my favorite things to relax
6603,378,uh huh,
6604,378,how are you at controlling your temper, <deep breath> pretty good it depends on the situation but most of the time i'm pretty good
6605,378,when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about, <deep breath> um i don't think i tend to argue with people i think i just get mad about situations but not at people directly <sigh>
6606,378,mm,
6607,378,okay,
6608,378,what's something you feel guilty about, <sigh> hmm <sigh> i don't know if i feel guilty about anything at the moment
6609,378,tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently, not sure i have one at the moment
6610,378,okay,
6611,378,what are some things that make you really mad, <deep breath> noise other people's noise makes me really mad um i live across the street from a bar and these people are so rude and obnoxious and not considerate about their neighbors that that just makes me really mad <sigh>
6612,378,that sucks, yeah <sigh>
6613,378,tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make, hmm <sigh> well the only one that comes to mind off the top of my head is is when i bought my condo it felt like a really hard decision at the time you know i didn't know that i could do it i didn't wasn't sure if i had the money to do it um so that felt like a really difficult decision but in hindsight course it turned out to be a great decision but at the time it was really difficult to do that
6614,378,yeah,
6615,378,how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep, pretty easy i sleep pretty well <sigh>
6616,378,that's good,
6617,378,how have you been feeling lately, <deep breath> for the most part good i'm i'm just really worried about money <sigh> at the moment so that's my biggest so i can't say that i'm like great but i it's 'cause i am worried but you know i'm also confident that things are gonna work out
6618,378,that's good,

6625,378,is there anything you regret, <deep breath> no <sigh> i really have worked hard on that i think there are lots of things maybe i would do differently but there's nothing that really i regret
6626,378,like what, um <deep breath> well i just think that there are things that um <sigh> like it's not worth wasting the energy to think about things that i regret so i don't have a lot of xxx regrets about things
6627,378,okay,
6628,378,what advice would you give to yourself ten or twenty years ago, <deep breath> oh that's a good question <sigh> um <sigh> don't worry about the small stuff and save more money <laughter>
6629,378,what are some things you wish you could change about yourself, like <deep breath> well there's uh you know the normal things like i'd lose more weight and i would um uh <sigh> think be a little more fearless maybe <sigh> be a little more bold

6659,379,yeah,
6660,379,i see what you mean, right yep
6661,379,i'm sure you can tell by my shoes i'm not much of a world explorer do you travel a lot,
6662,379,i'm sure you can tell by my shoes i'm not much of a world explorer do you travel a lot, yeah actually i do i mean i can't see your shoes but um yeah actually i do travel a lot i've been to places like hawaii been to the caribbean i've been to uh let's see <makes sound with mouth> um you know just different places like arizona i've been to oregon washington pretty much all over i would say so but usually mainly like um hawaii and the caribbean mexico as well so
6663,379,mhm,
6664,379,mhm, yep <clears throat>
6665,379,what do you enjoy about traveling, um i think it's just the experience you know like you can't you can kinda experience the culture um different people you know just just the whole background the scenery it's just you know it's it's something new to experience i would say something that you know people haven't seen before so
6666,379,yeah, <clears throat>
6667,379,i'd love to hear about one of your trips, well let's see i recently took a trip to hawaii a couple months ago that was back in december it was around christmas time new years so that was pretty fun we went to a couple different islands we went to uh let's see i think it was kauai went to oahu uh maui you know places like that so <clears throat>

6669,379,what's one of your most memorable experiences,
6670,379,what's one of your most memorable experiences, um you know i would have to say that um you know probably like in hawaii or like the caribbean you know just like i said before the whole experience factor just seeing um you know new different things things that are unique so <clears throat>
6671,379,mhm,
6672,379,what did you study at school,
6673,379,what did you study at school, yeah i actually study journalism right now i'm in my final semester so i'm about <bout> to graduate couple months <clears throat>
6674,379,that's great,
6675,379,that's great, yep
6676,379,how did you decide to do that, well you know it's kinda funny 'cause you know i started off at a uh you know a two year community college and so you know i was going into uh like business management something to do with you know i think <thin> basically um accounting but you know i kinda figured that wasn't for me so i decided to go into journalism 'cause i i couldn't i mean you know i'd probably still be sitting at a desk but you know at least with journalism i can go out in the field and you know talk to people and you know kinda you know receive information gather information that sorta deal and then you know write up stories
6677,379,yeah,
6678,379,yeah, i just thought it was you know it was a lot more interesting for me as opposed to you know just kinda crunching numbers all day so
6679,379,uh huh, yep
6680,379,i love my job you could almost say it's virtually made for me what's your dream job, <laughter> my dream job i would have to say um you know some something in maybe radio broadcasting sports broadcasting um you know i think that would be really interesting something that's definitely a passion of mine so <clears throat>
6681,379,okay,
6682,379,tell me about your relationship with your family, my relationship with my family it's it's pretty good you know i i live with my parents still like i said i'm twenty three years old um you know there's certain times when it can be a little bit shaky little bit rocky but for the most part it's it's pretty good you know i've i've matured a lot in the last few years so things are uh you know getting back up to speed i would say things are things are going pretty well <clears throat>
6683,379,that's good,
6684,379,that's good,
6685,379,do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing, you know i think it stems somewhere kind of in the middle you know sometimes i can be very outgoing and talkative to people when i'm relaxed and laid-back other times i kinda it's not so much like i go into my shell but you know at times like i can be kinda shy if i don't know people as well or if i haven't i've never met them before so it's one of those things that kinda <ki> yeah you kinda gotta meet me in the middle with it because you know i can either be talk very talkative or at times you know i i can be a little bit shy but you know once i once i get the conversation going i'm i'm fairly talkative and
6686,379,mhm, so <clears throat>
6687,379,sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax,
6688,379,sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax, <laughter> um you know usually um i would listen to music or you know maybe just you know kinda go for a drive or uh you know hang out with my friends you know just something to just to kinda you know ease ease that you know 'cause you know like i said sometimes you get a little bit you know tense and you just wanna relax and you know just do the things that you enjoy so
6689,379,mm,
6690,379,mm, <clears throat>
6691,379,how are you at controlling your temper,
6692,379,how are you at controlling your temper, you know i've actually been better with that um couple years back you know i there was points where like i pretty much couldn't control my temper like whatsoever like <li> i mean i would just pretty much get angry at you know the littlest things everything would just kinda tick me off but you know i've i've definitely learned to uh you know control that sorta thing and you know it's made me a better person because of it <clears throat>
6693,379,when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about,
6694,379,when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about, well let's see i'm trying to think it's it was probably something with my family with my mother maybe it's i i can't remember off the top of my head but you know it's it's always something so miniscule that that's why i probably don't remember it but you know eventually we make up and i apologize for it because you know i accept that you know i'm wrong in certain <cer> you know certain circumstances
6695,379,uh huh, <clears throat> yeah
6696,379,what's something you feel guilty about, something that i feel guilty about um probably you know not being as nice to others as i could've been in the past you know i mean and that is the past and you know i don't like to dwell on that sorta thing but i think that's one thing that i that i've tried to work on but it's also one thing that i kinda regret not doing just being just being nice <clears throat>
6697,379,tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make, hardest decision i ever had to make uh it was pretty recent kinda tough because uh i actually have a buddy he was in the air force and he recently got diagnosed with uh paranoid schizophrenia so that was really tough and it's hard for me to talk to him because you know he's he's not really all there anymore like he used to be so it's one of those things where i feel like i'm kind of ignoring him and i don't wanna do that but at the same time i don't know his tendencies he could be a little you know crazy so probably like you know some sort of like traumatic stress disorder maybe when he was in the military so i don't know but yeah <clears throat>
6698,379,yeah,
6699,379,that sounds really hard, yeah it's pretty tough you know 'cause we go way back been best friends with him <sigh> since i was probably about five six years old
6700,379,aw, so it's just yeah it's just really hard to deal with but you know i i try to i don't i don't  you know try to keep in the back of my mind but you know it's it's always there i don't i don't ever forget so yeah <clears throat>
6701,379,okay,
6702,379,okay,
6703,379,how would your best friend describe you, my best friend <laughter> well he'd probably say that you know i'm i'm a pretty pretty down to earth guy usually pretty honest sometimes brutally honest but you know i try to work on that too um he'd probably say that i'm pretty funny um i like to hang out you know just kinda do things here and there you know just normal activities like any other person you know go to the beach hang out watch movies you know grab a few beers that sorta deal so yeah
6704,379,mhm, <clears throat
6705,379,how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep, you know it varies sometimes it's easier than others you know if i'm really tired you know i'll probably have a very good sleep i haven't been sleeping all that great the last few days 'cause you know my house uh there's workers on the roof so they're you're putting in the new roofing so that's kinda tough so that always wakes me up early in the morning so sometimes a little bit crabby but for the most part i usually get a pretty good sleep <clears throat>
6706,379,okay,
6707,379,okay,
6708,379,how have you been feeling lately,
6709,379,how have you been feeling lately, lately eh been feeling pretty good you know because you know things are starting to look up i actually got an internship about <bout> a month ago for um you know my field of journalism so that's good about to graduate in two months so i'm looking forward to that um starting to make a little bit more money that's you know that's good and uh yeah things are just going pretty well right now i can't complain <clears throat>
6710,379,that sounds like a great situation,
6711,379,that sounds like a great situation, yeah it's it's not bad you know like i said it could always be worse right but you know i'm i'm enjoying life so it's the that's the best part
6712,379,right, <clears throat>
6713,379,have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d,
6714,379,have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d, i have not no
6715,379,have you been diagnosed with depression,
6716,379,have you been diagnosed with depression, nope
6717,379,do you feel down, no
6718,379,tell me about the last time you felt really happy,
6719,379,tell me about the last time you felt really happy, last time i felt really happy <sigh> man <laughter> you know it was probably going back to my buddy when you know he was still still had his sanity i guess you could say um we you know he came back to visit from the air force he had some leave so you know we were just hanging out um you know just kicking back having a few beers and just talking about life so that that was nice but i miss that you know so <clears throat>
6720,379,how did you feel in that moment,
6721,379,how did you feel in that moment, i felt great you know it because there's nothing like having a best friend you can have conversation you know twenty four seven about anything can tell anything to him in confidence and he could tell me anything in confidence like that's hard to find you know especially someone that you've known for so many years and then you can't really get it back now so yeah
6722,379,yeah, <clears throat>
6723,379,is there anything you regret, yeah there there's a there's probably one or two things that i regret um well i mean i regret <reg> i got a d_u_i about three or four years ago actually it was four years ago so that's something that i definitely regret because you know i look back on it and you know things might've been different but at the same time you have to accept you know the actions you know circumstances that took place so you know i manned up and you know i guess i think i'm better off for it but at the same time you know it's it's always gonna be in the back of my mind like i said it's just one of those things that you have to deal with in your own way <clears throat>
6724,379,yeah,

6728,379,tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory, um probably going back to uh my buddy with the whole uh paranoid schizophrenic thing i don't say that i wish i could erase it i just wish that it didn't happen like that so <clears throat> yeah

6733,379,mhm, <clears throat>
6734,379,tell me about a time when someone made you feel really badly about yourself, um well you know it's it's tough to think back but i would probably say a time when someone made me feel really bad is you know i would say probably like when i was you know kinda getting angry at certain people maybe just kinda chewing out my friends when i probably shouldn't have i was trying to give more constructive criticism but at the same time i knew it it was probably not my place to say those kinds of things and they were out of character so <clears throat>

6762,380,oh no,
6763,380,that's good,
6764,380,i'm sure you can tell by my shoes i'm not much of a world explorer do you travel a lot, i can't see your shoes actually uh but no i i travel xxx i would say i xxx i've probably traveled more than most people in the u_s like considering that most people don't travel in the u_s but i wouldn't i wouldn't call myself a world traveler or anything
6765,380,what do you enjoy about traveling, i enjoy the chance to get to like see other um walks of life and and and kind of like meditate on the the specificity of my own you know the the the the <th> given the parameters that i grew up under like how different everyone else is like how how every life is totally um i mean even just within the u_s like seeing how someone in california grows up is so different from how someone in maryland grows up and then to think about someone in like thailand or something growing up it's pretty it's pretty amazing
6766,380,uh huh, mhm
6767,380,i see what you mean,
6768,380,i'd love to hear about one of your trips, uh okay um hmm putting me on the spot here ellie
6769,380,(laughter, um let's see uh well um i it's been awhile since i've been on a trip i guess one of the last trips i did was to um i mean it a xxx like two years ago i went on road trip across the u_s and that was that was pretty amazing saw but i guess the best place <pl> the best two places on the road <roa> i drove from maryland to l_a this is before i actually moved out here but um i i visited new orleans and new orleans was just this whole like even though it's part of the u_s it's like a totally it's totally different than anywhere else it's so um unique the culture there is so unique and and the blend of like caribbean and french and all these other influences into like the american south is so so um uh incredible <incred> eh yeah it's just it's it's unreal <un> yeah it's unreal
6770,380,yeah,
6771,380,what's one of your most memorable experiences, hmm it's a tough question um one <on> um <makes clicking sound with mouth> i uh hmm you know i i i you can you come back to that question are you capable of that
6772,380,yes, yeah come back to it
6773,380,let's come back to that later, yeah that's what i just said
6774,380,what did you study at school, film
6775,380,how did you decide to do that, you know that's actually a question i've been asking myself i knew <kne> i know i my entire life i've had like phases of interest so when i was like very very very young i was really into like the first phase that i remember was keys and then tools like i would go around collecting keys and then i'd go around collecting tool like just every sort of tool i had a toolbox my parents have told me that i had a phase before that with which was balls like various balls um and then i was really into like insects collecting insects and reptiles and and stuff <stu> and like animals and then it was a dinosaur phase and at a certain <cert> and eh at a certain point i got really into um like rap <ra> like music like first <fi> at first rap and then uh guitar and then acting and then at some point in there i i had told <to> i rememeber telling someone that right now i'm interested in playwriting and and poetry but eventually i was going to be interested in in uh film like i i could kinda see the trajectory coming but i don't remember what led me to that conclusion i think i just always i was <wa> led a sheltered life uh as far as movies are concerned i didn't my parents didn't let me see an r-rated movie until i was like in high school almost like
6776,380,hmm, um and uh and i never uh so i never saw an r-rated movie i was also very squeamish like i remember when i was fairly young maybe like six i saw star wars the first scene in darth <dar> star wars darth vader crack like breaks a guy's neck
6777,380,uh huh, and so just a little scene very at the very very beginning and that like freaked me out and i had to leave the room so
6778,380,(laughter, i'm not really sure uh yeah it's it's it's um i don't i'm not exactly sure how i got into film but uh i've always been fascinated by like how people interact and what like you know acting and stuff so and movies in general
6779,380,are you still working in that, i am yes
6780,380,i love my job you could almost say it's virtually made for me what's your dream job, um to be a filmmaker to be able to direct and uh put <pu> put together and make <ma> like i guess direct i don't mm use that word so much 'cause it i think i think of it more as like i i want the opportunity to put together and make movies uh or to make movies is probably the best way to do it uh to say it 'cause i want you know i want involvement in all the all the processes but
6781,380,mm, i guess the best parabole for that would be a director directing
6782,380,okay,
6783,380,tell me about your relationship with your family, well it's a lot better when i'm not living with them um my i guess um it's funny you should ask ellie um i've been thinking about it a lot lately i i think i'm close in my entire family i'm closest with my dad um i get along with my brother and sister you know like but i don't when away like my brother's in a foreign country right now so i don't have the opportunity to talk with him but like i spend more time talking to my dad than anyone else 'cause i feel like he's the most like of all my family he's the one who most accepts me and like um thinks positively about me um so it's i have like a a complicated relationship with my parents i mean <mea> and my family in general
6784,380,mhm,
6785,380,do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing, well on the myers uh briggs personality test i'm uh i'm an extrovert but lately <late> like since moving but i'm not like um i'm not i probably would consider myself on the scheme of extroversion uh or on the scale of extroversion sorry um i would consider myself extremely introverted um
6786,380,why, i just i see other extroverts and just no matter who they're around they're able to like strike up conversations and i'm i'm a fairly shy person i'm sort of like uh or inhibited person maybe um so i like to like until yeah i'm but i'm working on it i'm working on it
6787,380,okay,
6788,380,sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax, um well in the past i would smoke weed but i've quit smoking weed so now i you know i have a glass of wine and maybe watch a movie um i don't have or maybe go like depending if it's like an xxx if it's um if it's a worn out sort of stress like i'm just like then i that's what i do but if it's a more like anxious type stress i might go on a uh an intense walk don't really exercise that much but i like you know competitive sports and hiking
6789,380,yeah,
6790,380,how are you at controlling your temper, pretty good
6791,380,when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about, well i always like arguing um i wouldn't call arguing necessarily losing my temper um i i enjoy uh a vicious debate um but i don't as long as my like 'cause i won't like revert to personal you know attacks uh in my in my arguments i try to keep it on subject
6792,380,uh huh, um and try to explain myself as best i can which can get frustrating 'cause i'm not like the best articulator of what i think um one of my weaker points i would say but um but the last time i had a a heated debate i think that was was that the question
6793,380,yes, um
6794,380,when was the last time that happened, what happened i forget i forget the question that that i had a heated debate
6795,380,uh huh, hmm the last time i had a heated debate was um i had a heated debate about uh the movie boogie nights um i was <wa> i i didn't lose my temper exactly but i get like very extremely passionate about about 'cause i i don't think it's like that good of a movie but the two people who i was i was arguing with were saying that it was like one of the like best um best movies <laughter> why did they think it was the best movie
6796,380,why,
6797,380,yes, um they think that like there's some there's some sort of they'll as i understand it they have um they have a certain uh they think that the like all of the stories within boogie nights they have their own um like each of them could be their own separate stories they just think that there's a whole like complexity of character within the movie and um that somehow like <sigh> um what what were they saying they were saying like the movie it like xxx it's like the end of an era which makes it like kinda like casino and there's this attention to detail of of of the in the different character like how they how they interact in the plot um kind of like uh yeah i guess i think the heated debate became about like then so from there and uh like personally i it's not like a bad movie or anything but it's the um i just don't think dirk diggler is like that like meaningful <mean> meaningful of a character like i i guess the way i come out i came out of the movie 'cause i had seen it before many years ago and eh i my opinion of it is basically the same even though like i remember like
6798,380,mm, in watching it again i was able to reevaluate it um there's nothing bad about the movie there's nothing articulable <art> like articulable about that's it's like solid <so> good solid acting you know the directing is good the camera moves are cool um the eh it really <rea> you know it's cool it's but but it's meaningless <mea> for me it was like meaningless and then to and then there were that led us to discuss 'cause a movie that i saw recently that i really did like was django unchained
6799,380,yeah, and they both saw that movie and they hated that movie and then there was this extreme i guess the heated part of the conversation came about like so in the movie django unchained um you have django and django is like a kinda he's a two dimensional character but i don't think that that necessarily takes away from what the the big the big purpose of the movie is
6800,380,right, and um and you have doctor king schultz who's this uh who's this like his mentor character and the person i was arguing with was saying that he was intelligent and uh so and because he was intelligent there's no way he would've risked his life to save django or like would've gone into this like second act where they go and they go to this uh uh plantation to to save django's wife etcetera and um and the reason <rea> the the reason for her giving that argument which like either you buy that he would do that or he wouldn't but the reason for her argument is that an intelligent person would not sacrifice themself for someone else
6801,380,hmm, um which strikes <stri> which strikes me as so like um like who uh like she she her basic <ba> her basic argument was that altruism <al> like altruism doesn't exist <exi> it was a very ayn rand type argument altruism doesn't exist um the only the only thing you can do is serve <ser> like the only thing people do is serve themself um so it's not quite ayn rand but it's like the only people <peo> thing that people <peo> like all people are out to serve themself which i'm not arguing that like every decision has like a mix of altruism and and so like even the most altruistic type decision there's maybe like kernels of self self-interest in there but she made it sound like self-interest was the only motivating factor
6802,380,yeah, in and and like what but what how how horrible is your life if that's like what your ultimate um purpose <pur> like if you if you can't like love and sacrifice for other people so it led into an extremely uh passionate debate um and uh somewhat like yeah and it's it uh so um so yeah that that i guess that's the the i don't think i necessarily like lost my temper um i think of losing my temper as being more um like i just so <s> i i would so <s> revert to um ad hominem like attacks uh but i i didn't like that's not um maybe i was like maybe i was criticizing <crit> like criticizing her world view but it i wasn't like well you're an idiot you know like it wasn't it didn't it didn't turn into abuse of any sort
6803,380,i understand, yeah i'm glad you understand <deep breath>
6804,380,tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory, an event or a i don't know if i necessarily would want to erase anything from my memory i would say an issue that i have is not being able to remember in as much detail as i would like i remember feelings and moments not stories um like my life doesn't sync <s> always sync together into like a coherent story it's like this moment and that moment and this moment and that moment so
6805,380,hmm, yeah
6806,380,tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make, the hardest decision i've ever had to make oh geez could it just be one of the hardest decisions
6807,380,yeah, hmm um like choosing between two things that it's like i guess i i'm having a hard time recalling a moment where i like had to choose between two options like no there's no like sophie's choice type moment in my life but i but i do think that the decision 'cause i lived in new york for a while i went to school in new york and uh the decision to leave new york after having lived there for five years was a was very very difficult um
6808,380,mhm, and uh but i had to do it for money reasons and because all of my all of my core group of friends were either like leaving <lea> were most of them were leaving and going other places in the world and then uh the one other person who i was close to was living with someone who i did not get along with at all so it was like this situation where i didn't i was either gonna live with people who i wasn't as close with or craigslist or or move home and i i think it was a tough decision to to leave i i had <ha> in fact it was so tough that the only way i could do it i had to justify it by saying that i would be moving back to new york within like a month or two uh which wasn't which didn't end up happening but that was the only way that i could leave new york
6809,380,i see,
6810,380,how hard is that, it was how hard was that or how hard is
6811,380,yes, how hard was that um it was hard <laughter> um it was it was yeah it was it was just a very like isolating isolating <is> 'cause also like i'd fallen <fa> like previously to that time i had fallen in love with one of my like closest another one of my close very close friends and uh that had kind of gone extremely badly and so i wasn't on speaking terms with her and i couldn't like that whole everyone on my list of friends who was like more <mo> closer to xxx her it was wasn't quite like her or me type thing but that that was the way that i kind of saw it at the time so i didn't like you know just being socially isolated etcetera
6812,380,yeah,
6813,380,that sucks, yeah
6814,380,how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep, well recently it's been awful um i uh i like two so the last last night i slept for like ten and a half hours um which seems to be the length of time that i have to sleep in order to have really vivid dreams but previous to that night so last not last night but the night before last and the night before that i got four hours and two hours of sleep um because i was working on set and i would get back and either and i just like couldn't fall asleep for whatever reason it's um too much riled up energy or something i i don't know
6815,380,mm,
6816,380,what are you like when you don't sleep well, tired uh very not immediately i guess initially upon waking up like i really enjoy being up in the early morning and um i also stopped drinking caffeine like i i've had like a little bit of coffee the last two days but before the last two days i hadn't had any coffee in like three and a half weeks so um i guess with with caffeine in my system i'm ready to i'm ready to go um without caffeine it's i'm just i'm just quieter i guess
6817,380,okay, more introverted
6818,380,have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately, since like lately as in when
6819,380,whatever comes to your mind, um change in my thoughts yeah i mean i guess when having just moved here there was a period of time like eh at the beginning where the the sheer difficulty of finding a job and finding people to xxx 'cause i moved here 'cause i have a group of friends here or couple of friends but i don't have like a a large number of friends and the the push to to get out there and meet people and find a job and that sort of pressure was pretty um overwhelming at first and i think that i'm slowly like coming to terms with that um and moving you know moving past it i i but not necessarily <nece> you know like it's still it's still there the pressure's there but i'm just you know you you know <sigh> you know <sigh>
6820,380,that's good,
6821,380,have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d, no i just
6822,380,have you been diagnosed with depression, nope
6823,380,tell me about the last time you felt really happy, the last time i felt really happy might have to reach back um i think the last time i felt really happy was uh during the writing process of so last year i shot a movie um co-wrote co-directed co-produced um and that was kinda like that it still consumes my life but um but i i i think during the writing stages of that movie in which we would bunker <bunk> like get up eat breakfast bunker down work really hard put stuff up on the thing just like pure creative full <fu> energy um between <betw> between me and the person writing it and and there's like probably like a xxx a day that i remember where it's just i remember going to bed and i was just so thrilled to be working on what i was working on and and and working with the person i was working with and like just like i felt like it yeah i guess that was the the last time that was that was like eh more than a year ago though but i guess it's hard to hard to think that i haven't been really truly happy since then but when you're making a movie like
6824,380,wow, you don't you can't allow yourself to be happy really <real> especially if you're doing it you know basically by yourself with <wi> with like xxx like can't
6825,380,uh huh, it's too much else to do so
6826,380,that makes sense,
6827,380,what would you say are some of your best qualities, i would say that i'm very accepting <acce> like accepting of other people and always eh i'm very empathic <em> empathic <em> empathic um and open <o> open <ope> like excited about new ideas and open to new ideas and yeah um
6828,380,okay,
6829,380,what are some things you wish you could change about yourself, hmm um i guess i wish i was less uh uh less ruled by fear more fearless <f> more fearless in my you know everyday interactions and in my like um you know zest for for living um <sigh> yeah i xxx i other things i would change about myself i'd i would i don't know <laughter>
6830,380,um,
6831,380,tell me about a time when someone made you feel really badly about yourself, hmm really badly about myself um <sigh> i think there are numerous <nu> numerous instances in my childhood in which my like uh like every single time there was an issue at school or some sort of um some sort of uh conflict with a teacher or anything my parents were always always on the other side of the court you know like never it was i i noticed or noticed as i got older that other people other parents were like if their kid was in trouble like there was something wrong with with like their kid was perfect there's something wrong with other people but my parents were it was always the opposite um in particular my mom so i would say that there a couple of instances in which um i was like blamed or like you know it was my it was my fault um when when what i was doing like yeah it's just thing things things that i couldn't like there's no yeah i don't know
6832,380,that sounds really hard, yeah
6833,380,what advice would you give to yourself ten or twenty years ago, ten years ago um stay stake you know like i i think that there's um i have a tendency to like i love <lo> love the fact that i have a tendency to get really caught up in ideas <ide> in an idea and like devote myself entirely to it but sometimes um ideas are too easily xxx i would just say like do as much as possible like don't don't decide that you um are only going to do one thing um try to like i guess i would've taken up like some done <do> taken piano learn learn to read music would be a big thing for me learn to play the drums
6834,380,mhm, would've been drums more than reading music i would say i'd love to learn how to play the drums and maybe done more like acting classes um as far as like 'cause i was always really into directing so i was always directing actors and stuff but i didn't it's only now that i um i don't know i guess stay uh don't stay <sta> stay stay focused <fo> yeah i don't know that's a tough tough question <que> tough question ellie

7040,383,right, but um yeah that's probably one of the biggest reasons why i just don't support these crazy tution hikes going around and um but another reason why i decided to leave i had to make a hard decision to decide to leave was  also because um art institute you know um that's a that's a funny idea in itself already and basically i was a musician being taught by a musician
7041,383,mhm, to make music and same with you know all the all the dancers or the theatre students you know getting taught dance to to a dancer from a dancer how to dance you know

7259,386,what's your dream job, oh probably to work as a uh gossip columnist at t_m_z or one of those networks <laughter>
7260,386,(laughter, but as you know everything in the entertainment business is very competitive it's who you know so but that would be my dream job or probably working with uh cats you know animals
7261,386,yeah, so
7262,386,do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing, i'm very outgoing in fact i think i'm so outgoing i scare people sometimes there's a lot of quiet you know reserved people out there so i'm kinda east coast very you know i go up to people and talk to them very social
7263,386,sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax, <laughter> <laughter> <laughter> oh my gosh there's i could do hundreds of things i could read i could watch a show turn on the music music is great um take a walk uh call my friends million things <laughter> so
7264,386,how are you at controlling your temper, i'm pretty good i'm very good i mean you know of course when you're driving in l_a and somebody cuts in front of you sometimes that can be irritating but i'm i'm actually pretty i'm not the type of person that will fight or get i don't like to have confrontations so

7266,386,that's good,
7267,386,when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about, mhm mm i can't really remember so as i said there's not very many arguments usually i avoid arguments at any cost <sigh> so
7268,386,okay,
7269,386,what's something you feel guilty about, i don't really feel guilty about anything <laughter> right now or that i can think of
7270,386,tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently, mm i can't think of anything right now
7271,386,hmm,
7272,386,tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make, i really can't think i of any decisions that were really hard i mean most it's pretty easy for make me to make a decision so i don't have a family so if i have to you know i had to move san <s>  to san francisco for a job once but since i'm single it's i don't really have to consider other people and children and that type of thing so it kinda makes certain things easier when you don't have a family to consider
7273,386,that makes sense, mm yeah
7274,386,tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory, an event hmm well obviously you don't you know the passing of a family member you know you wish everybody could be around forever so i know when my father died you know i mean i wish i would've had him for a lot longer i mean he died at the age of seventy seven and you know would've been nice to have him around a little bit more
7275,386,yeah, but you know can't control those things life has it's own way of dealing with that so
7276,386,there are always trade-offs in life aren't there, mhm yes there are <laughter> yin and yang that's ancient uh philosophy and it really applies there's pluses an minuses and negatives and positives
7277,386,mhm, so
7278,386,tell me about your relationship with your family, well as i said my dad's no longer here and my mother and i you know we have our differences i think mothers and daughters always do um my brother and i get along great i see him a lot i see <s> my sister works a lot i see her and you know we talk and she's kinda got her own life and her children i get along great with them so
7279,386,that's good, mhm we have a small family
7280,386,what do you think of today's kids, uh <laughter> once again it's like that's a hard question to answer there's so many types of kids out there i think majority of them seem to be pretty well-behaved i mean you know there's always gonna be children that are kinda out of control but um i don't know the ones that i've seen recently they're very well-behaved so can't say much else about that
7281,386,how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep, well <laughter> i live in an apartment <laughter> and i don't know if you've ever lived in apartment but um uh there's someone that lives above me i'm on the first floor and there's somebody on the second floor and they're pretty quiet but they have a habit of <laughter> i guess they have lots of energy um they usually will take their showers around midnight and sometimes they'll start washing laundry at midnight and of course the pipes run through the bedroom wall <laughter> so <laughter> so it sounds like niagara falls in there and uh so i don't
7282,386,oh no, yeah and i need eight hours of sleep and i've only been getting ooh i'd say like maybe six hours and then i usually wake up once at night too 'cause sometimes they'll kind of around two or three in the morning they'll either walk around or i'll hear something so i'm not getting a straight eight hours of sleep and it's definitely <laughter> but there's not like i said there's things you can't control when you live in an apartment you know i mean the the lady's uh very quiet it's just that she has a habit of you know taking later showers <laughter> washing clothes at night that's i can't say anything to her about that
7283,386,that sucks, so yeah but you know there's people that are in worse situations so i don't make a lot out of it you know and i just it's not like every night but it's you know at least twice a week so i you know i have to consider maybe sleeping <laughter> in another room but for now you know that's i'll deal with it so
7284,386,what are you like when you don't sleep well, tired <laughter> very tired and hard to focus hard to concentrate it just takes me longer to get things done 'cause i don't have my energy also i haven't been exercising i normally try to walk about half an hour a day but the weather's been kinda colder and kinda drearier so you know i'm not as motivated when the weather's kinda blah so it's a combination of both not getting my exercise and not getting eight hours sleep
7285,386,uh huh, mhm
7286,386,how have you been feeling lately, uh as i said before um tired <laughter> i'm i it's a combination of the weather you know and here in los angeles right now we're have been having very grey days i live very close to the ocean so the sun doesn't come out that much so i'm not getting my serotonin <laughter> i need that
7287,386,right, i um i'm not getting my eight hours of sleep because you know whatever and i think my thyroid is acting up too so that's kind of creating you know i have some vitamin deficiencies and you know once the sun comes out i'm kinda more energetic it just gives you that more energy so
7288,386,okay,
7289,386,have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d, no mm mm
7290,386,have you been diagnosed with depression, no
7291,386,tell me about the last time you felt really happy, i am i'm happy most of the time i'm a pretty happy person and i like to be around other people i mean of course i like my private time but i do like being around people quite a bit so
7292,386,tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed, hmm <laughter> can't think of anything right now i mean i usually enjoy everything i do there's nothing that stands out more than anything else so
7293,386,okay,
7294,386,is there anything you regret, no i never regret anything
7295,386,what advice would you give to yourself ten or twenty years ago, uh huh what advice would i have given well i guess yeah i could probably change things around i think it everybody could um i probably would've had a different college major um you know seems like <laughter> uh what else um i probably wouldn't have dated certain men <laughter>um wasted time with certain people um i don't know those are the things that come to mind
7296,386,uh huh, maybe started saving money earlier you know those types of things
7297,386,okay, but mm
7298,386,how would your best friend describe you, outgoing lots of fun to be with um uh just a good friend to have people like having me for a friend i'm loyal trusting and uh i listen i'm a good listener i'm very patient <laughter> as well so
7299,386,that's good, mhm
7300,386,what are some things you wish you could change about yourself, well <laughter> number one would be to lose weight but i think that's a worldwide problem i mean there's a lot of food around and temptations and um especially here in america a lot of us are couch potatoes we sit in front of our computers we you know it's just easy to relax <rel> it's so easy to relax you know it's hard to get up and move around you have to talk yourself into it so
7301,386,yeah, that's the weight you know has gives you more energy too if you lose weight so that's a big thing as well but that's probably the thing just the weight thing yeah
7302,386,i understand, mhm
7303,386,how would your best friend describe you, i think you might've asked me that question before <laughter>
7304,386,yes, but uh if you want i'll repeat it so
7305,386,what would you say are some of your best qualities, um i'm very uh like i said i'm very loyal uh when i tell people i'm gonna do something i do it very reliable uh i i'm warm i'm very friendly i'm um great listener and i you know i've heard so many people tell me they just like being with me so like i said i'm very i'm pretty upbeat you know i'm don't <d> i don't let things get me down too much so
7306,386,mhm,
7307,386,what are you most proud of in your life, hmm that's a hard question <laughter> the can't think i mean i'm can't think of to answer that one <laughter> so <laughter>
7308,386,what are some things you like to do for fun, for fun well i love movies i could see every movie that they make um i love going out with my friends shopping swapmeets um my gosh and traveling is great road trips um that's kind of you know part of it yeah that i mentioned so
7309,386,what do you enjoy about traveling, traveling getting to see different places the history aspect of it um the foods enjoying foods in diffferent countries uh the architecture it's just kinda neat to get away and see a completely different place
7310,386,yeah, mhm
7311,386,i'd love to hear about one of your trips, okay well <laughter> i've um been to a lot of places in europe i love paris uh it's such a walking city you can whoever designed that city i'll tell ya i mean it's you can get from one point to another the subways are great um each area has its own distinctive kind of there's the latin quarter where the students are there's another area where let's say the fashion designers are um kinda like our rodeo drive here in beverly hills there's an area that is more african <af> african and they have swapmeets on the weekends that are wonderful for international
7312,386,mm, and then like i said once you get out of paris there's just so much history you can go see versailles then there's other palaces you can go to the south of france you know it's but that's probably my favorite country i've been to italy as well so
7313,386,wow, uh
7314,386,that sounds like a great situation, yeah well after college people usually i mean people that go to college or either before or after college that's a great time to go to europe because you're young and you're not tied down you don't have a family and um you kinda have a more adventuresome spirit  you got more energy so carrying you know backpack or suitcases is not <laughter> not a big deal um so yeah that's mhm
7315,386,right, yeah

8113,399,mm,
8114,399,tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently, mm um well with my ex i could've ended it better so we could be on better terms now um i probably shouldn't have argued so much or tried to instigate so many things i probably should've just let it go with the flow and just see how it turned out

8119,399,tell me about that, um well he had a tumor that he had to get removed so it was just hard seeing him have to be in the bed and just be in the hospital when he really didn't want to be there 'cause he's a really live person and he'd rather be running around and stuff like that but just seeing him stuck in bed was just terrible
8120,399,yeah,

8125,399,yeah,
8126,399,how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep, um depends on the night some nights it's pretty hard some nights i fall asleep like a baby
8127,399,what are you like when you don't sleep well, um usually creative actually when i can't sleep i'll just stay up and i'll write something or read a book and ideas will pop up um stuff like that it's usually a good thing when i can't sleep it's nothing really bad 'cause i'm having bad thoughts or anything like that
8128,399,okay,
8129,399,how have you been feeling lately, um lately between a mix of good and bad i have my happy moments when i'm energized and i'm live then some nights some days where i'm just you know just sitting there just mellow thinking not like my live self

8181,400,i'm sorry to hear that, thanks
8182,400,do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing, definitely more shy i've always been that way
8183,400,why, uh <sigh> eh just the personality that i've grown into but learning how to adjust to the sensitivity and grow out of it
8184,400,mhm,
8185,400,sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax, oh tea and um you know eating i like to eat i mean that calms me down
8186,400,how are you at controlling your temper, uh eh not that good when i get really upset it's usually a problem and i have to work to calm myself down and sometimes i just don't get on something and i don't stop
8187,400,hmm,
8188,400,has that gotten you in trouble, sometimes but i've learned to control it to that extent now
8189,400,when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about, <laughter> yesterday i was arguing about what sort <s> what kind of water we should be drinking
8190,400,why, uh well a difference of opinion and i felt as though my opinion was very valid um even though uh the other party's opinion was somewhat misinformed
8191,400,uh huh,
8192,400,tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently, um definitely uh every day is a growing process i wish i would've handled everything differently every day which is what um makes me grow and i try to work toward how i would've wanted to handle things every day little by little
8193,400,okay,
8194,400,tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make, um <sigh> can't think of anyone right now
8195,400,what's something you feel guilty about, um <sigh> i'd i'd i'd say uh not supporting my friends as much with their career choices <sigh>
8196,400,can you tell me about that, uh i'd rather not get into it <laughter>
8197,400,okay,
8198,400,who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life, <deep breath> um <sigh> the raw food educators on youtube and <sigh> um raw vegan educators and the detox therapy <therap> therapy uh experts have been really inspirational in the past two months
8199,400,tell me more about that, well uh they believe that um the essence of all nutrition comes from the raw fruits and vegetables and this is true with many studies like t colin campbell the china study and um the sources of information that are uh that that are very good and i i think deserve respect based on you know real research <laughter>
8200,400,uh huh,
8201,400,how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep, really easy i've uh almost got it down to a science
8202,400,that's good,
8203,400,what are you like when you don't sleep well, uh i'm tired
8204,400,how have you been feeling lately, been feeling better than i have in a long time
8205,400,can you tell me about that, uh yeah i think it's uh due to the transition in the diet and in no way having a placebo effect that it's actually you know loosening up toxins and things that have accumulated over my short life time of um you know toxic choices with food and drugs or whatever it would be
8206,400,mhm,
8207,400,have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately, <deep breath> yes um less tense and less irritable and uh i have more clarity and more control over my uh decisions and my wants versus what i need that sort of thing

8214,400,do you still go to therapy now, no
8215,400,why did you stop, uh i believe i overcomed a chapter in my life that was the the doctor um you know taking control of my health and experimenting with drugs and i just sort of took another route which was alternative and i started juicing more and um just trying to listen to maybe what i needed with the help of uh the internet and nutrition experts and stuff like that
8216,400,mhm,
8217,400,do you feel like therapy is useful, yes
8218,400,can you tell me about that, uh i believe therapy is useful because um <sigh> without looking inward or having somebody to help you do that um it's very hard to readjust to some of these problems that you can have that will just uh resonate in the subconscious until you you know it has an outburst it basically um therapy um will help in overall health and mental health i believe for everybody
8219,400,yeah,
8220,400,tell me about the last time you felt really happy, last night um i made a really great vegan uh dinner with you know meat tacos and cheese and guacamole and had a couple of my friends over and they really liked it a lot and i almost converted them <laughter>

8364,402,how did you decide to do that, well um i was physically ill with uh chronic fatigue syndrome and i had a client that referred me to this person um because he had cured her of that disease and um that was um he treats multiple issues and so everything is interrelated so um once i had my first conversation with him i knew it was the right step for me

8563,405,whatever comes to your mind, okay well i guess my current family comes to mind i i have two daughters and my relationship's pretty good it's okay with them but they're teenagers which uh you know going they're going through a lot of hormones and um they can be kinda bitchy <laughter> and
8564,405,(laughter, and um but i have hoped that you know they'll grow out of that and soon someday we'll have a really good relationship um and then there's the husband which i i guess i could say soon to be ex husband hopefully soon  <laughter> we need to get a divorce but we're still together due to financial reasons and yeah
8565,405,okay, yeah so that that's not good the the relationship with the husband but um but since we have determined that we need to divorce our our we don't expect anything out out of each other so we don't argue as much so that's good
8566,405,yeah,
8567,405,tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently, hm well i guess our marriage i wish i had noticed early on that you know it was like way off from what i thought it was

8569,405,can you tell me about that, um well you know we were married and i wasn't content i guess you could say um and i kinda just gave up on our relationship and i i now that i look back i think it's because i wanted children and he would've been happy to never have any and so uh since i didn't have a father it was very important that i create children with someone who really wanted to be a father and so i was kind of at a age where i needed to start thinking about having children yet i was with someone who really was not into it so that i think that's one uh maybe the core reason why i was not content and i just felt like <tisk> this marriage isn't gonna work and so you know we went to therapy and everything and he did not wanna break up and <tisk> um <tisk> and i had to leave him because i just wasn't happy and that was that was very  hard 'cause you know i felt like i was hurting him  which which i was you know and he survived he got over it now he's  married with two kids <laughter> <laughter> but um it was hard to leave him
8570,405,yeah,
8571,405,tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory, mm something i wish i could erase from my memory i have to think about that i'm sure there's something <gasp> oh well yeah there's um i guess it'd be nice to erase from my memory  um a recent i mean not recent but an event in my recent adulthood here in culver city where one of my best friends um i've betrayed me by back years ago when my husband first got into real estate she and her family were growing and they really needed  a larger home and um we just assumed that you know that they would use my husband as their agent both to sell their current home current at the time and purchase a new home <tisk> and as it turned out they surprised us and had been talking to this other local agent and uh yeah that was devastating i don't think i had ever  been betrayed like that so i wish i could  erase that now 'cause now you know this was back when the kids were really young and um my daughter at the time my youngest daughter was let's say six maybe um maybe five anyway her <h> her and my best friend's daughter are the same age they were born within days of each other we were pregnant together and um they were really tight those two little girls and they ended up not going to the same elementary school  so they didn't get to hang out during those years but every time we'd run into them in the neighborhood or they'd run into each other at a summer camp or something they were just so connected they were just you know like two peas in a pod even though it's her their moms weren't talking to each other anymore so now they're thirteen and fourteen and they're in middle school together and they're still very connected in fact <laughter> she she for the first time spent the night at our house last night with my daughter and another girl and it's just a little awkward you know 'cause now these girls are becoming really good friends better friends um and yet i still have this vivid um bad memory of what her her mom did to to me
8572,405,yeah, that was about what ten about eight years ago anyway <sigh> i tried to i tried to
8573,405,i'm sorry, ignore it and put it out of my head and which i've been able to <sniff> in recent years but obviously it still comes up
8574,405,yeah, anyway that that was that
8575,405,how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep, <sniff> um not that easy i do sometimes get a decent night's sleep but sometimes it's hard to get to sleep and most of the time i wake up and can't get back to sleep uh or i finally get back to sleep and then it's almost time to get up you know that that difficult thing
8576,405,are they triggered by something, well the waking up in the middle of the night is definitely triggered by having to go to the bathroom <laughter> and then um <tisk> you know it's not always that easy to get back to sleep and then i wake up again to go to the bathroom so i guess that's the trigger as far as getting to sleep having a hard time there i don't know i think there's just too much on my mind running through my mind and the day i feel like i haven't accomplished enough during the day so it's hard for me to just go to sleep when i'm supposed to i guess
8577,405,okay,
8578,405,what are you like when you don't sleep well, um well i'm kinda used to it now so i just go on through the day probably looking <laughter> looking tired and um i i'm kinda used to feeling tired i just do what i need to do and sometimes if i'm able to if i'm at home and don't have huge commitments yeah i might just like i said earlier just take a nap or something read my book watch t_v watch whatever
8579,405,mhm,
8580,405,how have you been feeling lately, lately how have i been feeling um kind of down on myself down on life
8581,405,can you tell me about that, well i have this pending need <n> need for separation slash divorce um <tisk> i worry that i made a lot of mistakes with my girls now they're teenagers you know on the verge of adulthood <clears throat> and so i worry that you know i did all kinds of things wrong with their guidance and their early childhood and  <clears throat> now it's too late um like i missed out on a thing <th> a lot of things uh and yeah i need a job i'm unemployed i don't know what i wanna do with my life i know i wanna do something i i i just wish you know i never did finish college unfortunately because i was traveling and stuff so i i regret that extremely and i need to get a job and be able to take care of myself 'cause i need to divorce and move on with my life so now i forget what the original question was but  <laughter> um that's the state part of the state of my life
8582,405,okay,
8583,405,have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d, no
8584,405,have you been diagnosed with depression, yes
8585,405,how long ago were you diagnosed, mm <tisk> well the first time or or or recently
8586,405,yes, the first time i guess was you know when i was in my early twenties i was just a little upset about <laughter> coincidentally that was another breakup i had to make back then i was um <tisk> in my early twenties and i needed to break up with my boyfriend but again it was very upsetting 'cause i you know it was hard because he didn't wanna break up and i felt like i was hurting him and i didn't understand this feeling i was really upset how i didn't that was my first time having depression so i didn't really recognize <r> recognize it as depression but i went somehow i had the knowledge or the i was able to take myself to a psychiatrist i remember i paid for her by the hour and she prescribed xanax to just help relax me and so i guess that helped me get through that and then i've had depression throughout the years just you know little bits here and there for various reasons such as i guess it's usually a relationship <laughter> you know um yeah so the most recent time i was diagnosed and put on meds that was probably about two years ago
8587,405,mm,
8588,405,do you still go to therapy now, no
8589,405,why did you stop, um money i i don't have insurance otherwise yeah i'd be happy to go to therapy <laughter> anything that might help
8590,405,tell me about the last time you felt really happy, ooh <laughter> boy last time i felt really happy um i don't know i guess maybe when my children were born that's
8591,405,how did you feel in that moment, <laughter> um i guess happy i don't know <laughter> i just you know i always wanted children so it was nice to have them that's i don't know that's all i can remember of that i don't i guess i don't remember the good times too well <laughter> i remember the bad times
8592,405,yeah,
8593,405,tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed, <sniff> mm something i did that i really enjoyed well let's see i um friday night i went to a friend's house and met up with five other girlfriends and we we created vision boards and talked and had dinner at one of their house that was that was fun
8594,405,that sounds like a great situation, yeah we get to
8595,405,what advice would you give to yourself ten or twenty years ago, ooh <sigh> stay in college get my degree um get therapy try to become a happy um yeah try to figure out things earlier in life like yeah stay in college and oh and mainly i think the main you know what it all boils down to <laughter> no matter what you're depressed about it seems like as as the saying goes and the songs <s> the songs go you know it's all about money the world revolves around money and having none that in itself is very depressing <laughter> so besides relationships and different things  that have happened in your life having no money is you know it's like you can't even try to fix anything because you don't have the money to fix it so with that in mind i would uh definitely advise myself to get my college degree and to stick <s> get a job and stick with it um don't quit to go traveling you know just stick with a job stick with a company build up your seniority keep your benefits and build up some knowledge or some expertise in some sort of field yeah that would've been my biggest piece of advice to myself
8596,405,okay,
8597,405,what are you most proud of in your life, not much <laughter> i guess just my daughters you know they're beautiful daughters and i'm proud and glad that i was able to have children some people aren't even able to do that you know and they  try so hard or they look back on their life and they wish they had done it so that's the one thing i mean i wanted five children and i always wanted a boy which i never had but um i'm i guess that's the biggest thing i can think of to be proud of is having my two daughters
8598,405,what would you say are some of your best qualities, um i'm a very loyal friend and person that's why when that friend betrayed me it was so devastating yeah very loyal um very <inhale> happy <hap> i mean huh what was i gonna say i was gonna say happy lucky <l> go lucky i don't know where that came from i'm very i meant to say friendly and caring and um yeah i care about people and i'm interested in people and i care about animals as well actually that's another thing i'm proud of proud of being a vegetarian yeah so my daughters and being vegetarian i'm a vegetarian because i really care about feelings of other beings not only humans but animals too and you know i don't think that animals should be  tortured and live a a tortuous life just so we can eat 'em
8599,405,yeah, so um what was the question do you remember the question

8670,406,goodbye,
8671,407,hi i'm ellie thanks for coming in today i was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment i'm not a therapist but i'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you i'll ask a few questions to get us started and please feel free to tell me anything your answers are totally confidential are you ok with this, yes
8672,407,okay,
8673,407,so how are you doing today, <clears throat> i'm actually feel <f> i feel pretty good 'cause i uh i slept all day yesterday almost and i usually i'm doing something if it's not work it's school if it's not school it's work and then social life and all that so um i actually didn't have work yesterday and i don't have school i only have school on the weekdays so i actually slept probably like eighty five percent of the day so i actually feel kinda good but i'm actually kinda tired as well and i have other stuff going on but other than that i'm good today
8674,407,okay,
8675,407,where are you from originally, i'm originally from bakersfield california
8676,407,really, really
8677,407,when did you move to l_a, uh i moved to l_a when i was an infant and then i left here when i was around three or four and i've been move i moved back here in oh seven and i've been living here um ever since
8678,407,how often do you go back to your hometown, um wow since i've been here since oh seven i've only been back maybe <clears thoat> maybe like a couple times <ti> well i went there for like a summer like in oh eight i think i was there for like almost the whole summer but i've only been back a couple times um since i've been back here unfortunately
8679,407,how does it compare to l_a, uh <sigh> uh <laughter> uh it compares to l_a um it doesn't really compare to l_a i i grew up in sacramento actually i didn't get to tell you i was born in bakersfield then i lived here and then i anyways i don't know if i did i forgot anyways um yeah there's like nothing really to do there it's really small it's the valley um l_a has all the stuff to do it has um oceans and it's by all kinds of um located um by a lot of um cool places like vegas and uh san diego and what have you not so <s> um but yeah other than that i miss my friends and stuff but i don't miss like the actual city i just miss uh some of the people that i grew up with
8680,407,yeah,
8681,407,i'm sure you can tell by my shoes i'm not much of a world explorer do you travel a lot, oh i can't see your shoes but um i don't travel a lot actually i've only been out of california like six times so i would like to travel once i uh have enough money to do so
8682,407,okay,
8683,407,what did you study at school, um well originally i wanted to be a filmmaker and which i still wanna be a filmmaker and i um studying <stu> i was took i took communications and uh did general ed stuff too and um took like video production classes and um <tisk> <lip smacking> did a lot of stuff uh in regards to um filmmaking and i have learned a lot of stuff and i still have that knowledge however i haven't really used it since i've been back here in l_a i did all that stuff in northern california in sacramento but um and then i transferred <trans> um switched over to be uh to business which i took some classes in that but now i'm actually studying to be an optician and i'm actually almost done with schooling and getting ready to try to get in the field and become an optician so
8684,407,wow, but i do wanna be uh i actually still wanna be a filmmaker and um that's still one of my plans and i still actually i got into um playing poker a few years ago and i really like the idea of becoming a full time filmmaker or full time poker player however both of those jobs are extremely difficult to make a living out of and you have to be like the small percent so we'll see if not then hopefully my optician career can take me somewhere
8685,407,what made you decide to do that, to be an optician
8686,407,yes, oh um uh i guess i was just trying to find something that it was like it's like a trade it's well it's a private college but it just like specifically trains you into um one field and you just learn that you don't do like your g_e and all these other classes like you normally would do for like um like a um a major or whatever you're gonna do so it just trains you specifically to be an optician and jump in the field i um took it just because i actually want <w> want to be a dental assistant and since <si> it sound like something maybe i could do it sounds interesting but then the counselor actually um got my attention to be an optician so i'm now trying to be an optician
8687,407,that makes sense, and it's interesting so it's fun it's um really hard but it's interesting and it and it um and it's it's fun it has um rewarding um rewarding benefits as far as like being able to help people see better and feel comfortable with glasses or contact lenses whatever they feel more comfortable with
8688,407,that's great, cool
8689,407,do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing, uh i'm definitely outgoing however i can be shy sometimes like i'm kinda shy right now because talking to you and you're uh in a computer and you're a cartoon
8690,407,(laughter, or uh animated or whatever <laughter> so cool but no usually ninety eight percent
8691,407,sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax, <laughter> um i actually which it is actually kinda funny and i think maybe this might go for some of the poker players too um i don't really i've never really talked to any professional poker player but as far as like um i actually playing poker is um actually something that helps me forget about anything as far as like um stuff in the past or present um or future stuff that's coming up uh as far as like i am really relaxed <rela> i really um could just not think about anything and just think about poker and it actually it's kinda like a therapy thing for me 'cause i don't like i guess you could say it's a kinda drug because um i don't think about anything as far as like stressed out or depressed or stuff that's happened in the past i just like focus on poker so it's actually kinda relieving however playing poker is very stressful on top of that so i guess it's kind of like um catch twenty two or whatever but uh
8692,407,hmm, yeah so no poker i play like to play basketball i like to watch movies i like to go to the beach actually one of the things i like to do is go to the beach 'cause it does um it makes me feel good but it i didn't go i usually only go to the beach when it's hot not during the cold season so it's coming up soon so i'm looking forward to that i'm gonna be busy but uh i'll try to go out to the beach as much as i can <laughter>
8693,407,okay,
8694,407,how are you at controlling your temper, um i'm really good at controlling my temper actually i've only been in like i'm thirty years old i've been in like six fights maybe and all six of 'em were started by the other person so i've never started a real fight in my whole life like i started fights when i was a little kid but talking about like real stuff like once you get passed it at like thirteen fourteen <sniffle> uh but yeah no i'm good like every now and then like there's been a couple times maybe in the past where like i wasn't able to control it but um as far as like ever being violent or anything that's never occured and never would but for um majority of the time yeah i don't have like people do stupid things all the time and i just like let it go especially like um on the freeway and stuff but uh
8695,407,when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about, oh well i mean i argued a bit with my ex girlfriend a lot but uh it was just about really um petty things i guess that maybe we just i think we were good for each other but uh maybe some other lifetime because uh we just bumped heads too much so obviously she's my ex girlfriend probably for a reason so
8696,407,mm, we just argued about girlfriend boyfriend things
8697,407,tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently, uh um i guess my filmmaking <filmm> um handled differently there's a lot of stuff i could've handled differently but uh uh maybe like when i was doing really good when i was younger and i was um working for scrubbed_entry production assistant for filmmakers around um where i lived in sacramento so i was doing everything that i wanted to do as far as my dreams are concerned and had a lot all my stuff together i had my own car my own apartment and then i got involved with like uh the wrong group of people i guess and kinda tumbled downhill from there and like lost everything like car job apartment so i just wish that maybe i never got involved with those kind of people that kinda of girl um uh ever uh because <clears throat> i woulda probably it probably my life probably would be a lot different now however i believe that everything happens for a reason and obviously i think you should also like if stuff happens good or bad uh <sigh> uh learn from your other mistakes so that when it happens again you could um not make that mistake or try not to make it as bad i guess so
8698,407,yeah, you know
8699,407,tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make, mm hardest decision i guess i guess uh hardest decision the hardest decision i have ever had to make would be um i guess you could say uh i don't really know was gonna say that uh maybe like my ex girlfriend like i could've like stayed with her and i really like still am in love with her and uh would like to be with her and miss her but i guess the biggest mistake <mis> um decision that i had to make was like i know that it wasn't like a healthy relationship and i know if we like stayed together or if we got married or had kids that i don't think it would end up working out anyways so i guess the decision my hardest decision would be to like actually stay away from her and not get back with her and uh be uh not with her so i guess that was a hard really hard decision because um i could easily have done it and i guess maybe i would've been happier in that way but stressed out and um irritable or whatever and the other way of having to deal with her i guess deal with each other our our relationship so it was really hard still is so uh i guess that's it not choosing to be with someone that i i loved and loved me or whatever so
8700,407,mm, cool
8701,407,tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory, oh what was that i beg your pardon
8702,407,tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory, nevad i don't understand the first part of that question
8703,407,tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory, oh an event oh an event okay um that i could erase <sigh> uh event that i could from my memory uh my ex girlfriend i wish i'd never met her my first girlfriend and my last girlfriend i wish i never met them 'cause uh we <w> we were together in love for a few years and then we broke up and it was really hard so i guess both of them

8804,409,mhm, yeah
8805,409,what are some things you don't really like about l_a, uh it's pretty much the same year round as far as well actually the weather could be good and could be bad you don't get to get all four seasons so it's it's kinda like a mixed bag and um i guess i maybe i'm kinda used to it by now so it'd be kinda nice to explore other areas i've lived here all my life having done too much traveling so uh it's a little bit of uh kind of a ruttiness to it but uh overall it's okay
8806,409,okay,
8807,409,what did you study at school, uh well i took computer programming in operations but that's going back to the seventies so it's technology's changed a lot as you can tell <laughter> in the last forty odd years <laughter>
8808,409,yeah, that's why that's my that was my major yeah
8809,409,what made you decide to do that, um i don't know it's kind of it's kind of inquisitive you have to use your mind uh it was like you know brand new something you know very novel back in the in the old days you know back in the seventies now it's everything to computers but back then it was sort of like <sniff> something very unique um you didn't see you know too many computers around back then and um i worked in programming so i was kind of into the logicalness of it you know putting together you know solving a a particular um problem you know come up with step by step solutions on i guess all sort of back then i was kind of more into the the analytic <ana> analytical <ana> analytical <ana> analytical<anal> i can't say that word now <laughter> the analyticalness of the um the problem
8810,409,mhm,
8811,409,are you still working in that, mhm uh no i kinda phased out i still use computers but i haven't gotten i been haven't been in programming for a long time
8812,409,why, um well i kinda got into a another area kinda diversion <di> uh diversion <divorcion> to diversion to another area in my life uh this is going back to the um the late seventies i kinda took another turn and then by the time i kinda got back into it it was i kinda got into another field so i never really pursued it to the degree that i wanted to
8813,409,what's your dream job, wow that's a good question <laughter> i never thought about that uh well actually kinda <ki> ironically <i> ironically actually something was pretty simple at this point in time this is why maybe i'm kinda like made me a little bit depressed and then i um at this point i kind of just wanted kind of just do a nice relaxing job but but i do want somewhat of a challenge but i don't want to have to like do too much too much thinking that's almost like the opposite of what i was back in the in the old days you know i just want a nice comfortable relaxing job that i i can feel fulfillment on but i don't wanna too tense of a situation i'm kinda at the point in my life where i just want a nice relaxing job
8814,409,yeah, yeah <laughter>
8815,409,i see what you mean, yeah
8816,409,do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing, oh i would say well for the most part shy but sometimes once i get going i could be outgoing um but i generally speaking i'm i'm shy to begin with and then i at times i can kinda loosen up and be more vocal and sometimes i can take it to the to the extreme where i'm talking too much like once the funny gates open up they kind of <laughter> open up too much so i have to like back off you know
8817,409,(laughter, but overall i would say i'm kind of shy as as a general demeanor
8818,409,okay,
8819,409,sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax, oh really <laughter> <laughter> yeah <laughter> oh um well i listen to music um i'll um well i watch t_v um i'll um just what what do i do to relax well i just try uh avoid stressful situations so like kinda i stay relaxed i also talk to my friends too i'll be around an area around kind of a comfort area where i i feel safe i can just dialogue with people so kinda gets me out of my thinking about my own problems i'm having i kinda just you know focus on being in the moment with my um acquaintances <acqu> friends and acquaintances
8820,409,mm,
8821,409,how are you at controlling your temper, um i'm pretty good i don't really have a temper problem it takes a lot to get me to uh to explode i think when i was <w> in my younger days i think i was a little bit more had a little bit slight bit of temper i never had a really bad temper but uh uh temper is not really an issue i have i i tend to be pretty mellow easy going
8822,409,that's good, yeah
8823,409,when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about, wow that's a good question um i'm not sure to be honest um i'd have to think about that for a long time <laughter> to be honest i i can't come up with an answer on that it's not really part of my repertoire um nothing comes to mind off top of my head
8824,409,okay,
8825,409,tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently, well um well the only thing i can think of and kinda going way back i made some bad investments <in> bad investments back about ten years ago i was more um i'm trying to think of what word i'm looking for more trusting of people like uh people and like uh <tisk> who i thought were expert in their field and um i uh i inherited some money i was a little bit careless with it and i just kinda had a vibe you know that uh nothing would go wrong kinda a little bit of naitivity <nait> naitivity and um unfortunately i made some bad financial decisions it kinda put me in a bad position for the rest of my life unfortunately um because of a medical conditions i have it's hard for me to rebound and you know make it all up so i would say mainly uh financial uh investment decisions that i really regret
8826,409,i see,
8827,409,tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make, wow hmm that's a tough one i can't think of anything off the top of my head <laughter>
8828,409,okay, okay
8829,409,tell me about your relationship with your family, oh well uh don't really have too much family left the only one i have is my um it's just me and my uncle and we communicate <c> we communicate on a regular basis um he lives <li> but he lives in clearwater florida so uh we're we're okay but um uh he's like eight he's he's in his eighties and obviously i'm in my fifties so um we we do we have kinda a small talk he's kinda concerned about my well being but it's kind of on somewhat of a shallow <sh> on a shallow level it's not we don't get really deep and uh he's got his own problems so we don't really get into too deep of a conversation and other than him it's really there's not really anybody else i have so it did it probably makes me a little bit depressed 'cause i don't really feel i have anybody i can really count on or really confide in
8830,409,okay,
8831,409,how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep, um it is challenging uh i don't know why but i do have a medical condition so i think that might be part of the problem and um i have a little bit of b_p_a so ocassionally i'll get up have to go to the restroom and um so to to answer your question <laughter> to make a long story short <laughter> um it is challenging to get a good night's sleep i usually uh wake <w> wake up feeling a little bit tired or achy so it is it is difficult
8832,409,how have you been feeling lately, uh <sigh> well i've been feeling okay i mean um i've been kinda feeling mellow actually um i'm i'm trying to address issues that i haven't taken uh responsibility for but um i feel a bit of calmness as of late
8833,409,that's good,
8834,409,have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d, no
8835,409,have you been diagnosed with depression, well i did say yes when i filled out the questionnaire and um i'm not positive if i was technically diagnosed with it i did take a uh i think it's called m_m_p_h
8836,409,mhm, the minnesota multifaceted personality something of whether this is going back about six months ago they were asking me questions about my memory but then they also got into questions about my my well being psychologically too and i think some of the the answers said that they advise that i see a psychologist or a psychiatrist i didn't follow that up on that because of philosophical differences but uh i think i might have a you know a mild case of depression
8837,409,why, well you know um like i said i'm just kinda like kinda going along in life i'm uh i'm doing okay but i you know i kinda life's passing me by so i haven't really fulfilled my my goals i you know i'm kinda like alone i'd like to have a girlfriend i don't have a girlfriend so that's kind of somebody who i feel i can get close to and i'm not really i'm kinda in a transitional period in my life right now so uh there's a little bit of uncertainty i have some you know kinda financial uncertainties so um you know overall i'm not doing as good as i'd like to
8838,409,okay,
8839,409,tell me about the last time you felt really happy, wow that's a good one <laughter> really happy um let me think about that a minute well actually um it wasn't that long ago actually i went to um <makes sound with mouth> okay i know that one actually i can come up with an answer um i helped out a lady she was at a at a tradeshow it was anaheim it was a natural products expo so it was pretty nice we uh we had some nice meals afterwards there was a lot of exhibiters giving out really nice samples it was in anaheim so i kinda got a chance to get away from l_a and um you know met some interesting people uh they were very outgoing they were willing to like have me experience their product or service and um i was around people that i work with who uh i got to socialize with so uh i think i was pretty happy back then and that was about uh about a month ago
8840,409,that sounds like a great situation, yeah yeah it was
8841,409,how would your best friend describe you, best friend i don't know if i really have a best friend but uh i would say um hmm i don't know technically i really don't have a best friend so it's really hard for me to answer that so uh i can't really come with an answer to be honest <laughter>
8842,409,what would you say are some of your best qualities, um i i like to be conscientious i you know i do have flaws and every but i think overall i'm conscientious i try to be honest for the most part on the on the major issues i might you know say little white lies or you know i'm not perfect on that but when it comes to the serious stuff i tend to be pretty honest and i'm i'm a hard worker i got <g> got good work ethic um i tend to be pretty calm for the most part
8843,409,mhm,
8844,409,is there anything you regret, um what do i regret well can you elaborate that <laughter>
8845,409,whatever comes to your mind, uh well um i just well just overall um i regret uh not being a little more assertive in in my earlier uh earlier life um and kinda put myself in this position it's going kinda goes back to my financial decisions that was sort of that's sort of like my albatross in my life i made some bad decisions and unfortunately i have to kinda pay the price for now so i kind of like sort of like living sort of a pauper existence right now which is kinda kinda depressing so i would say that's probably what i regret most of all
8846,409,mm,
8847,409,what advice would you give to yourself ten or twenty years ago, well i'd say to really you know analyze kinda go with what you really feel um i think i was going with other people's opinion other people's advice i was kinda going away from my basic beingness you know like the way i really felt like for example i'd make i would do aggressive uh investing which if it turned out good it would've been like sort of like winning the lotto i would've been well off for the rest of my life <laughter>
8848,409,yeah, but unfortunately it went the opposite way too too many eggs in that basket so i kinda regretted going with my gut feeling and and let other people influence me and uh 'cause by nature i'm a conservative person so i should really do more concervative investments in other areas my life i tend to be more conservative but i kinda made some aggressive financial <f> financial decisions so that's pretty much kinda it always goes back to that area as far as what i regret
8849,409,right, yeah
8850,409,tell me how you spend your ideal weekend, wow that's interesting uh well i've been doing a lot on weekends so <laughter> <laughter> well i do like like to be profitable uh i like to do something where i can actually you know make money that's sort of like my bread and butter time 'cause i do tradeshows but if i'm not doing that then i like to maybe watch some um you know i'd like to go to entertainment maybe go to a ball game uh go to a movie go out with some friends so i would just or you know just kinda kick back but my main primary <prima> primary focus would be on you know earning earning money on the weekends
8851,409,mhm,

8853,409,okay i think i have asked everything i need to, okay
8854,409,thanks for sharing your thoughts with me, my pleasure
8855,409,goodbye, bye now nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan
8856,410,hi i'm ellie thanks for coming in today i was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment i'm not a therapist but i'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you i'll ask a few questions to get us started and please feel free to tell me anything your answers are totally confidential are you ok with this, yes
8857,410,okay,
8858,410,so how are you doing today, uh i'm fine today today is my daughter's birthday
8859,410,aw,
8860,410,that's great,
8861,410,where are you from originally, california
8862,410,really, yes
8863,410,what are some things you really like about l_a, um the beach
8864,410,mhm, i love the waters
8865,410,what are some things you don't really like about l_a, the gang violence violence
8866,410,okay,
8867,410,can you tell me about that, um i lost a lot of friends growing up in um through elementary and high school just losing them through gang violence
8868,410,i'm sorry to hear that, yeah thank you it was pretty tough out there <laughter>
8869,410,yeah,
8870,410,i'm sure you can tell by my shoes i'm not much of a world explorer do you travel a lot, um haven't been to any place out of california yet so not really
8871,410,okay,
8872,410,what did you study at school, um i'm an optician i'm a certified optician and i also have my associate's degree
8873,410,that sounds interesting,
8874,410,how did you decide to do that, um actually i went in i didn't really know what i wanted to do when i first applied i just knew i wanted to change my life and do something successful um before i settled down and you know had my daughter and everything um actually my guidance counselor kind of helped me and i i always thought like they were so cool 'cause their white long lab coats
8875,410,what's your dream job, to be a optometrist
8876,410,why, um 'cause i'm already an optician and that's like the first step and um what i why is a good question it's because then i would have a be able to have my own business and i would have something successful to leave to my daughter and she wouldn't have to really want to anything it would be like a a family business but a a to help the community as well and something i could leave for my daughter
8877,410,that makes sense,
8878,410,tell me about your kids, uh my daughter she's five years old uh she'll be starting elementary school next week and today is her birthday uh five years ago i had her <laughter> um she is very smart um i taught her home i home schooled her for five years and um she's adorable she's my heart
8879,410,do you find it easy to be a parent, no this is like the hardest job ever <laughter>
8880,410,what's the hardest thing about being a parent, it's very hard providing providing uh making sure that you wash their clothes um 'cause 'cause i mean it's hard enough to be um a parent but i'm a young parent and i'm a little more mature than her father so it's um it's it's the providing part i would basically say making sure that you have everything that they need it's so complicated let alone um it gives you enthusiasm to be more to go the extra mile um even being here today i probably would've still been in bed but today is my daughter's party and i was trying to make whatever extra little money i could make you know to make sure that she has a good day so it's all about uh going the extra mile doing anything that you can do to provide <pro> to provide for them but it it's a very hard job
8881,410,yeah,
8882,410,what's the best thing about being a parent, um that moment of the day when your child tells you how much they care about you and um my daughter her favorite thing is to tell me i'm her i'm her heart you know and and how many i mean just call your name it just it's a sense of reality um to be called mom or to call call dad and it it just like it infatuates you it also let you know like this is reality this is this is my life this is what i'm living right now and it's a it's a very good feeling that's the best part of being a parent
8883,410,that's so good to hear, thank you
8884,410,what are some ways that you're different as a parent than your parents, um a lot of different things i'm actually taking care of my daughter <laughter> um i'm here with her uh i was raised by my grandparents so i mean i didn't really i didn't get to know my mom til i was sixteen and my father i mean i couldn't point him out on the street on the sidewalk so i don't know who he is so i feel that um i'm very different from them because no matter how hard the job is getting i don't give up
8885,410,yeah, yeah
8886,410,who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life, um i guess i there's been <yawning> oh excuse me um there's been a lot of different people that have been very positive in my life i can say um my sister she was a good influence on me to get into the medical field she's in the uh she's an l_v_a and um she's one of my older sisters um i can say me believing in god being in my life god being in my life has also kept my strong and to know that i don't have to take on this world by myself because god is there for me and um hm i don't know i don't really look up to a lot of different people because people lie so and that's the most what i could think that's been positive for me
8887,410,okay,
8888,410,do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing, i think i'm outgoing <laughter> i used to be shy um coming up as a kid and i don't know i don't know what happened to me uh one day i just broke out of my shell and i've been um very accurate of showing my personality off <laughter>
8889,410,(laughter,
8890,410,sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax, um i actually like for the waves to collapse against the rocks at the beach and i like to just sit there and just zone out everybody else that's there and rub my toes in the sand and that is so relaxing
8891,410,mm,
8892,410,how are you at controlling your temper, um <yawning> excuse me sorry about that um i learned not to uh 'cause it's a form of it's a form of knowing who's in control and is it your life or someone else's and i feel that my temper me controlling my temper is showing that i'm in charge of my life so i don't even let stuff get to me i don't even really remember the last time that i had to control my temper because that's how much i try to block out the  the negativity
8893,410,that's good,
8894,410,when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about, mm probably my husband <yawning> my daughter's father um uh probably over like uh you know the dishes or like the small things but not uh physical altercation like with another human being no
8895,410,okay,
8896,410,what's something you feel guilty about, wow um being honest i kind of feel guilty about how things like uh basically how things ended um before my mom passed i wish that i could've helped her a little more even though people tell me not to feel bad um because she wasn't really there for me growing up but i kind of feel guilty like you know not being there as much as i could've been for her before she passed away so i think that's something that i um i still feel guilty for
8897,410,okay,
8898,410,tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory, um going through my mom passing away
8899,410,how did you feel in that moment, um i felt like <clearing throat> i felt like um basically that it was i felt kind of robbed in a sense like i felt everyone else had parents and i grew up with my grandparents and then for me to go so many years without actual you know mom and dad for me to get eighteen years old and then then she leaves me it was kind of like um i don't know it was nerve wracking because i felt robbed you know it was like i didn't have her all these years and then now that i'm older and i'm i don't even have her now so
8900,410,yeah,
8901,410,i'm sorry,
8902,410,tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make, um signing the paper of having a c section when it was time for me to have my daughter i was so nervous so scared um really didn't know what to do how to take it and i mean like that was so scary
8903,410,what made you decide to do that, um it was the safest way of bringing my daughter into this world
8904,410,are you happy you did that, yes
8905,410,that's good,
8906,410,how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep, it's hard <laughter> i didn't even sleep last night that's why i'm yawning <yarning> but um uh i i kind of tend to try to do everything and i have to get back to that stage where i have to think about myself as well and give myself time
8907,410,mhm,
8908,410,what are you like when you don't sleep well, um a little like this but actually i'm a little nicer today <laughter> um just groggy
8909,410,okay,
8910,410,how have you been feeling lately, um <yawning> lately i've been feeling very confident about um being positive about going the extra mile of being a good parent
8911,410,that's great,
8912,410,have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately, uh <yawning> yeah i actually really don't care what other people think anymore i used to let that bother me but i don't no more

8927,410,thanks for sharing your thoughts with me, wow thank you
8928,410,goodbye,
8929,411,hi i'm ellie thanks for coming in today i was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment i'm not a therapist but i'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you i'll ask a few questions to get us started and please feel free to tell me anything your answers are totally confidential are you ok with this, sure
8930,411,okay,
8931,411,so how are you doing today, pretty good
8932,411,that's good,
8933,411,where are you from originally, new york
8934,411,really,
8935,411,when did you move to l_a, uh i moved to l_a in the seventies
8936,411,that's a long time, but i yeah but i lived a lot of different places
8937,411,how often do you go back to your hometown, of um i guess every few years but i travel a lot so i've lived in i've lived in africa i've lived in spain switzerland hong kong too
8938,411,wow,
8939,411,what do you enjoy about traveling, um different cultures food music rituals uh everything the smells the colors makes you feel alive
8940,411,i'd love to hear about one of your trips, excuse me
8941,411,i'd love to hear about one of your trips, one of my trips
8942,411,mhm, uh i lived in kenya for about a year um i'd say i love horseback riding so when you're uh viewing other animals when you're kind of disguised in the scent of a horse you can approach the animals a lot closer so um it was great seeing red orange fall sunsets and riding along you know uh seeing so many animals yeah
8943,411,what's one of your most memorable experiences, in kenya um probably when i went to a a masai village and i happened to i used to live in hawaii and i've had been to tahiti and i was wearing one of those pareos that are hand painted and i had it tied over the left shoulder with the twisted in a knot and i happened to enter a masai village for the first time uh that day and i looked all around and the men were wearing their clothing exactly with the same twist <laughter> on the same shoulder and they came over to me and they said why are you dressed masai
8944,411,(laughter,
8945,411,(laughter, and uh <laughter> and um then they came back and gave me what appeared to be uh some very large what looked like beaded leather bookmarks but they were actually earrings so they would've like weighed my ears straight down and um and then then they gave me some bracelets and then they had uh me wear something around my waist and they said now you look proper masai <laughter> so but i i yeah i just i have a lot of uh i think living
8946,411,aw, getting a chance to live in different countries around the world i've just uh you feel alive all your senses are completely you know uh awoken yeah
8947,411,that's great,
8948,411,do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing, <sigh> i think it's not so clear cut i think a lot of peoples are a hybrid of both i mean i think i can be extremely shy sometimes but extremely brazen uh and very courageous at other times probably one of my best virtues is i'm very gutsy person so when i really feel passionate about something i risk everything to go achieve it sometimes um i believe that um usually i well i make decisions very quickly and i find that i have a friend who makes decisions very slowly and he said to me tell me how i can make decisions quicker and i told him i said well in each case you always have no choice and he says what do you mean there's hundreds of choices and i said not really because it's gut wise is only one and it doesn't really matter you waste time physical energy emotional energy mental energy reflecting all of it when gut wise you always know what the choice what you really wanna do is and it doesn't matter whether there's a ninety eight percent chance of failure even if it's a two percent chance of success you have to go to the one that may yield you joy so i always go to that it's it's to me a waste of total time and energy to even think about another choice 'cause who cares if you remain unscathed but it when it yields no joy
8949,411,yeah,
8950,411,yeah,
8951,411,i see what you mean,
8952,411,sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax, uh pardon you said you put your fish
8953,411,what do you do when you are annoyed, what do i do when i'm annoyed
8954,411,yes, um <sigh> <tisk> i think when i'm annoyed sometimes i it's because sometimes i can have i can need to be a little more patient um i guess you really have to put yourself in somebody else's shoes rather than the way you would react you have to have more empathy
8955,411,how hard is that, um not really i think that's the reason why i enjoy traveling so much 'cause you're put in other situations where you're forced to to um understand other people's lives a lot more regardless of how different they are uh from yours different situations i've been to so many third world countries and and lived in so many different situations that you <y> it it helps create that which is why travel is really the best education there is
8956,411,yeah,
8957,411,when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about, <sigh> let me think um <tisk> uh <sigh> last time i argued about something um god i'm trying to remember <laughter> um oh i think it was when somebody didn't respect actually my privacy in something
8958,411,can you tell me about that, um uh <sigh> oh i know what it was um it was somebody who belonged to the uh uh scientology faith um i uh inherited i inherited um possibly uh a immune disorder from my mother my mother died from lupus and um uh i sometimes even right now i have like skin rashes welts and everything and i am very photo sensitive and um <tisk> i had an you know an episode where i was i had big flare up and i wasn't really feeling well i felt flushed and everything and the scientologist tells me that i needed to be audited and um and he said something about are you aware of past lives and i had told him that i was buddhist and i was kind of curious that if you're going to try to recruit somebody to convert to your religion at least you should find out the other person what religion they are just to even be informed and to be able to talk to them
8959,411,yeah, and i and he said that are you aware that um <tisk> about something in your past and i go yes i believe that many religions uh including buddhisms and scientology believe that things that you have <ha> have had in your history sometimes affect you or things that you keep that anger issues bitterness um resulting from even your past relationships or your parents and such can affect and make you even sick make you even have cancer yes we believe that and also <a> we also believe i said that you know that you have the power of each person has a god like or a buddha like nature to go ahead and you can make yourself even when i'm on the verge of possibly being i probably get one cold maybe every fifteen years i don't have a tendency to be sick at all and a large part of it is i think when i think i'm on the verge i take sort of like and i did this even when i was a child uh when i was seven i would fold down i had my boo boo and i would take <ta> i would say i would have the good part you know help the bad part <laughter> from a simplistic way in terms of a child
8960,411,right, and i would actually even when i was in a very severe car accident where i got cut by glass my whole back i concentrated healing and and when i went back to the hospital the doctors actually had the nurses come and say this is incredible that just <jj> her last week her back was so severely cut this is incredible healing thing so i believe that but uh um uh but i was just i think annoyed and irritated a little because the scientologist told me that because he had taken twenty or forty courses and he these certificates on his wall that he felt that he was more enlightened and it didn't <did> it wasn't even a matter i said of whether he was um whether he took twenty forty courses or whether i'd been practicing buddhism whether it was for five ten fifteen twenty years or whether somebody'd been practicing some type of christianity for fifty years and bending sitting in a church pew every day it doesn't mean this person could have never attended church and be more spiritual than somebody who has
8961,411,yeah, you know so i just was thinking that was the antithesis of somebody who says they're enlightened but it's just the way i guess he kept cramming his uh you know his faith down my throat that after a while i was pretty patient with him but he it was so pompous that i became irritated
8962,411,yeah, especially when he kept telling me that it was audited and yet the same person needed a hip surgery
8963,411,i understand, uh the following week and i didn't point it out to him 'cause i just didn't wanna get into it but one could say hey you have a bad hip 'cause you need to be audited that that something that you did in your past otherwise you wouldn't need to get a hip surgery i mean i believe to some extent things that can be caused by people themselves and then he's flippantly said well are you aware of scientologists believe that past lives can also affect you know and i'm thinking to myself buddhists of all religions are are kind of like well known for you know believing in in a cause and effect and past lives situations and i found my thought he should really read up if he's trying to convert other people <laughter> from other religions so but um <tisk> you know i i you know i i just didn't you know care for the fact that he wouldn't drop it <laughter>
8964,411,yeah, but other than that i mean i don't
8965,411,tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently, <sigh> um uh <sigh> sometimes to have a little more tact i guess when when it's in terms of patience
8966,411,mm,
8967,411,tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make, i can think of that right away i guess uh disconnecting my father when he was like a vegetable in the hospital
8968,411,i'm sorry,
8969,411,how did you decide to do that, mm <sigh> mm my brother uh was supposed to be the strong one supposedly because he is in the medical field so my sister and i said well you know he's the medical one so he's probably used to seeing this all the time but it turns out he was the weakest one and even after you know my boss my father kept you know um um you know bucking the his body would actually be fighting the artificial respirator and all kinds of things you see all this jerking of body movements and stuff it was just very hard mm but you know it was after a while the uh you know even the physicians and even the uh pastor from that particular uh hospital <ho> you know hospital they said that he was no longer like even if he was to awaken from that he his brain function would've been <b> been you know negligible
8970,411,yeah,
8971,411,that sounds really hard, yeah it was mhm
8972,411,tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory, hm mm i don't think i really have that many things that are that traumatic that happened to me that i've had to block them i really don't know what it is within my makeup which doesn't make me feel like i need to like i don't keep i have friends that have unmitigated issues which they're not even aware of that affect their behavior or maybe their bitterness or their anger or their hatred or their fear and for some reason i i feel blessed that i don't really i can't really even think of something that i mean i've had some bad situations happen to me but it's not that the some reason they've traumatized me in affecting you know my behavior where i would where i block it that i'm not aware of something or i hold residual negativity for some reason so i really can't think of anything i mean there's bad things that happen and i know they're there but it's not like i feel like i it's necessary for me to block them 'cause i've been able to you know um accept sometimes <so> sometimes there were unfortunate things that happened
8973,411,okay,
8974,411,how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep, pretty easy i can usually make my sleep i self sleep in any situation if i have a one hour flight to san francisco i could just kind of lean against the window with the pillow have the blanket over and even on an hour flight pass out before the plane has even taken off from the ground so i can just <j> i have literally when i've had little sleep and i very uh high energy so i don't really need that much sleep but say like if i'm in africa and i <tisk> bumpy potholed unpaved road and i suddenly saw that i need a few moments of sleep i'll just prop something up put my elbow against the window and say i think i'll gonna take a nap for <laughter> fifteen minutes go like this and through the jostling i coud just take a nap for fifteen minutes so i don't really have <ha> have that problem
8975,411,(laughter,
8976,411,that's good,
8977,411,how have you been feeling lately, okay pretty okay i mean i could deal without the skin flare ups but you know from the photo sensitivity and all that but other than that i'm in pretty good spirts uh huh
8978,411,have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately, have i ever studied <s> studied what
8979,411,have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately, uh i could still couldn't hear you i'm sorry
8980,411,have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately, have i ever studied changes <ch> changes in my behavior what was the word
8981,411,have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d, um no
8982,411,have you been diagnosed with depression, uh uh
8983,411,tell me about the last time you felt really happy, um <sigh> i don't know just with friends and everything just even this past week just seeing friends that i enjoy being with and just having a great meal laughing just you know having a good time listening to music
8984,411,is there anything you regret, regret about my entire life you mean or are you talking about just recently or what are you talking about
8985,411,whatever comes to your mind, mm you know it's funny uh i find that a lot of the negative experiences that in in my life that have happened have also been uh um opened up experiences that are that are also great that i have not overlooked for example i got totally ripped off by my business partner to the tune of my whole <wh> my whole savings and i've had to start all over again and sometimes people sat to me like are you sure you're okay are you are you just pretending to be okay or are you angry do you wanna seek revenge if i was you know 'cause my business partner essentially ripped me off we knew each other's families which was even more difficult in a way um and uh he stole essentially my whole life's savings essentially in a way and he was <w> got sent to prison and the f_b_i was involved interpol was involved uh i was living in switzerland and my father was sick and i was going back and forth and um <tisk> uh but you know if i hadn't get involved hadn't <ha> hadn't gotten involved with him in business i wouldn't have had the a lot of rich experiences and i think sometimes the reason why i don't know why i'm such a positive person but for some reason uh i'm able to it's not that i'm purposely trying to i do see the positiveness in even horrible situations i wouldn't have gotten to live in barcelona and zurich i wouldn't have learned to speak as good spanish german <g> german uh lived in in europe if i had not gotten involved in business with my business partner who ended up ripping me off but and there's a lot of other experiences and different friendships that i developed during that period of time and in a way it was a total different life uh a different world that that would you know that i would've never um had the chance you know to live through if i had not involved my you know but of course it cost me financially and but then again i've always been the type of person who you know money isn't everything and i think the when i least cared about money is when i made the most of it so there you go
8986,411,yeah, <laughter> and for example one of my favorite times in my life probably when i lived in kenya and you would think that you know a lot of people have this really bad vision of it maybe looking living in mud dung huts or something and living very primitively i mean it it's not like that at all but i and you'd think that with the least amount of uh technological <tech> technological innovations and stuff like that i mean actually and i really didn't have you know that much many <m> many material goods at the time i mean i had the blast i had probably the one of the best years of my life when i was living in kenya
8987,411,mm,
8988,411,that's so good to hear,
8989,411,what advice would you give to yourself ten or twenty years ago, the same thing that i did probably when i was about fifteen or sixteen um to live your life with passion and again like choose the way i was saying earlier about making decisions you have to make those decisions gut wise what will give you a sense of awe and wonderment what would make you give you joy and you have to it's it's regardless what the percentages are even if you only have a one percent chance of success you have to go towards that 'cause that's the only thing that will yield you know the happiness in your life
8990,411,mhm,
8991,411,what are you most proud of in your life, <tisk> the fact that i've adhered to that and been brazen whatever you wanna say have the balls the chutzpah the cojones to go ahead and follow my passions and you know and i guess people call them sometimes strong decisions usually decisions that are easy <ea> when you where you remain unscathed usually don't yield joy that's just murphy's law that's just the way it is
8992,411,yeah,
8993,411,okay i think i have asked everything i need to,

9086,413,mhm,
9087,413,how does it compare to l_a, um overall i think i like where i'm from better than l_a in general
9088,413,why, um i think that other than it being somewhere i'm familiar with the type of people that are there are just more my type and what i'm used to and it's less superficial
9089,413,i understand,
9090,413,why did you move to l_a, <tisk> um i moved out here for college after i graduated high school and my mom and sister live in california
9091,413,how easy was it for you to get used to living in l_a, um initially it was easy because i felt like it was a new experience so you kind of adapt and just are experiencing everything at once but then after the first few years when it really sets in how different it is and what life is out here it became more difficult than originally
9092,413,mm,
9093,413,what did you study at school, uh fine arts and photography
9094,413,that sounds interesting,
9095,413,how did you decide to do that, um i was interested in photography since high school um i did a lot of programs and got awards and things like that and publishments so i decided to pursue art
9096,413,are you still working in that, um yes i have a fine arts degree that i got last year and scrubbed_entry
9097,413,awesome,
9098,413,are you happy you did that, yeah i really enjoy working or interning in forensics um i like that better than initially what i wanted to do was freelance photography i feel like it's a more secure job and it's very interesting
9099,413,what's one of your most memorable experiences, um that's a interesting question i guess just my childhood in general growing up
9100,413,can you tell me about that, um well my family's very close um my extended family as well and they all live <li> most of them live within the area or in the east coast in general so we would always do large family uh parties and things for holidays and religious purposes and things like that
9101,413,that sounds like a great situation, yeah it is really fun and we try and all get together as much as possible which is more difficult now since everyone is spread out amongst different states and countries
9102,413,yeah,
9103,413,do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing, um i consider myself more shy
9104,413,sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax, um i watch reality television i think it's kind of funny and lighthearted
9105,413,like what, um i watch like bravo t_v like the real housewives shows and just like funny things that you don't really need to pay attention to
9106,413,okay,
9107,413,how are you at controlling your temper, um i'm good i guess i don't really have like a temper if i'm having if i'm more stressed out it it definitely shows in in my attitude it but i don't really have like anger
9108,413,uh huh,
9109,413,when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about, um well me and my boyfriend like bicker all the time <laughter> just like about like insignificant things but other than that um i had an argument with my dad a few days ago
9110,413,can you tell me about that, um there's been like some tension going on since i went and visited over the holidays this past winter things about his girlfriend and he thinks that i should be the one to make some kind of effort to have a relationship with her although he doesn't for whatever reason think that it should go both ways so for like the thirtieth time he we were on the phone and he was <sigh> telling me how i need to call her and speak to her and i told him that i was going to do it over this past weekend 'cause of the jewish holidays and he kind of was just like very mature and telling me oh forget it she doesn't want to hear from you now and kind of just like i could care less because i i don't care about having a relationship with her so if she doesn't wanna hear from me you know it's easier for me
9111,413,yeah,
9112,413,that sucks, um
9113,413,tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently, i mean every time <t> i mean it's been the same recurring argument a lot and i wish that i could sometimes i do but i wish that the times that it turns into an explosive fight that i could just bite my tongue but the thing is is that he says certain things that are untrue or things he knows that like will tick me off that are really nasty and that he shouldn't be saying to me so he so i kind of just like lose it and i can't really mm like not say anything
9114,413,yeah,
9115,413,i'm sorry,
9116,413,tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make, um well i guess the hardest decision i made which i it didn't i only realized that it's the hardest decision like looking back is once you decide where to after you graduate high school where to go to college because for me i basically changed my entire life and moved away and did all that on my own so it didn't seem like that hard of a decision at the time it felt like just like a progression of the next step but looking back now that's probably one of the hardest decisions i made
9117,413,okay,
9118,413,tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory, um well i wish i could erase the event or seeing my grandmother's funeral which obviously it wouldn't change anything but it wasn't seeing her there was not something i'd wanna like have in my memory
9119,413,yeah,
9120,413,who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life, um she was she was a very positive influence and always was not judgmental um and now i mean my parents are great role models just in general i mean they're very successful people so whether or not we have like disagreements or that we're separate people they kind of are good role models in terms of what you wanna have when you are older
9121,413,mhm,
9122,413,how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep, um usually it's easy the problem is staying alseep no matter how late i go to bed whether it's ten p_m or four a_m i will be up like clockwork by seven thirty or eight o'clock in the morning the latest every single day and i can't seem to figure out why i cannot stay asleep longer
9123,413,are they triggered by something, no i just in the morning i guess i'm a lighter sleeper but i just wake up like i just cannot stay asleep anymore which never used to be a problem this consistent but now it's i cannot remember the last time i slept past eight thirty in the morning
9124,413,hmm,
9125,413,what are you like when you don't sleep well, <tisk> i mean it just makes if i have to do stuff during the day it makes it a lot more tiring but it doesn't really i'm so used to it now it doesn't really change my mood it's just part of everyday
9126,413,okay,
9127,413,how have you been feeling lately, um i don't know i kind of just feel very mm like so so just no extreme highs no extreme lows it's kind of one note land
9128,413,have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately, i mean nothing like lately um like recently it's just i would say over a period of years i've kind of progressively become more seclusive and just reserved and not very outgoing
9129,413,have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d, no
9130,413,have you been diagnosed with depression, no i have been diagnosed with anxiety
9131,413,what got you to seek help, um i had some breathing problems for a day or two and i had to go to the hospital um 'cause i thought it was more serious 'cause i couldn't breathe but they said that it was a physical manifestation of my anxiety
9132,413,do you feel like therapy is useful, i think in the right setting and with the person who's doing it if they're open minded and the therapist is helpful and good at what they're doing then yeah
9133,413,do you still go to therapy now, no i haven't been to therapy since i was a kid
9134,413,why did you stop, um i went because my parents thought it would be a good idea to like deal with whatever issues they were having with me but it was never i mean we just sat around and talked about my day it wasn't i didn't feel like i needed therapy at the time so i didn't really get much out of it
9135,413,i see what you mean,
9136,413,tell me about the last time you felt really happy, <sigh> well i was happy when i was back home at my boyfriend's house with his family over the new year's holiday when i'm there i can always just we save up our money so it's a complete vacation i don't have to worry about paying bills i don't have to worry about what i have to do tomorrow who i have to deal with i just every morning we wake up we hang out just enjoy the day
9137,413,that's great,
9138,413,is there anything you regret, in general
9139,413,yes, um i regret the college i chose to go to i didn't being from the east coast the whole collegiate system is set up a lot differently and the universities out there are not the same as the tight knit california school system out here so when i was researching colleges i kind of thought that santa monica college was just a general college just like boston college back home or you know any other school with the name college at the end of it i didn't realize until you know the end of my first year even that it was more like a transfer school like you you can't i didn't even realize you couldn't get a bachelor's degree from there when i went
9140,413,yeah, so it kind of create created more problems for me
9141,413,what advice would you give to yourself ten or twenty years ago, <sigh> well considering i'm twenty two <sigh> i'd probably say ten years ago i would give myself the advice to probably stay closer to home and to have really pursued other options rather than just be completely invested in moving to california
9142,413,how would your best friend describe you, um my best friend would describe me as a great charismatic funny outgoing socially enjoyable person which is different than how people who aren't my good friends would describe me which i mean i don't i mean it is what it is i am very outgoing and and have a great time when i'm with my friends in my element but around strangers and in like uncomfortable groups and things i just i am very shy and don't really speak much
9143,413,uh huh,
9144,413,tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed, um recently my friend was visiting and we went to a clippers basketball game a few weeks ago and i really enjoyed that
9145,413,nice, yeah
9146,413,what would you say are some of your best qualities, um i'm very caring i i'm a very good judge of character which i mean i guess i mean i consider it to be a quality <qu> quality for myself um i'm very affectionate <aff> i mean i'm not very affectionate i'm more i mean i guess i guess so

9174,414,do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing, i am super outgoing and i love talking to people a lot i like i like being the center of attention usually <laughter>
9175,414,sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax, i um i like to watch mindless television like um toddlers in tiaras and um duck dynasty just t_v programs where i really don't have to pay attention at all
9176,414,okay,
9177,414,how are you at controlling your temper, i'm okay at it i get really emotional really fast but i am usually able to to keep my anger down and not like lash out at others and stuff for the most part
9178,414,has that gotten you in trouble, sometimes i get into like arguments and fights with my friends and people who are important to me really easily and i hate apologizing to people so the fights could last pretty long
9179,414,when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about, um my best friend <laughter> ryan i think and it was about our relationship and just how we kind of messed it up and crossed some lines and uh where how were gonna go back to the way it was before

9181,414,i'm sorry, me too <laughter>
9182,414,tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently, <laughter> too many um i guess scrubbed_entry when i had a boyfriend and he has a girlfriend which was not okay i wish i would've just realized that this was bad and just would've stopped there and not have let it continue for weeks which led to my break up and then our friendship being really messed up
9183,414,could you have done anything to avoid it, i guess not spend as much time with him as i did be more assertive
9184,414,tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make, um i guess it was in november i was very depressed and suicidal so i told my friend what i was feeling and that she needed to take me to the e_r and from the e_r i had the choice to i don't know i guess go home or get sent to a mental hospital and even though i felt like i didn't have a choice i knew it was my choice and i decided to go to the mental hospital which was like the worst experience of my life ever
9185,414,can you tell me about that, um <exhale> it was awful it was in chicago and um it was scary i mean i didn't know anyone and they just like take all your stuff and they put you in some scrubs and they just start giving you medication and you're basically left to your own devices there were only like three group therapy sessions a day and everyone there was mostly men and um they were all really old and it was scary i didn't know anyone everyone most of the people there weren't depressed they were violent <laughter> so that was pretty scary and i just um it was really hard for me <laughter>
9186,414,yeah,
9187,414,what made you decide to do that, i had been so depressed for like a month i stopped going to my classes and work and i told my teachers lies about being sick and i just kept calling in sick to work i dropped a class and i was failing my classes and not turning in any work and i wasn't talking to any of my friends and i was drinking a lot and passing out and vomiting everywhere and i was just in a really bad place and when i finally was gonna kill myself i realized i needed help
9188,414,that sounds really hard, it was
9189,414,what got you to seek help, um i had severe depression when i was a younger teenager and i tried to kill myself then and i um got put in therapy for quite some time so i figured i don't want to go down that bad path again i just wanna get better so i had to do it i had to get help
9190,414,do you still go to therapy now, i do i go once a week
9191,414,do you feel like therapy is useful, i feel like if you have the right therapist it's really useful i had one therapist that i really liked and i thought we could've gone really far but sadly she's back in chicago and i'm in los angeles so i have to
9192,414,aw, i have to make do with this new therapist and she's okay she's not we're not that great together but she's who i had right now

9293,416,that's a long time, yeah it's been a while
9294,416,how often do you go back to your hometown, actually i haven't been back <laughter> i like l_a
9295,416,why, i like l_a
9296,416,how does it compare to l_a, mm it's a big city so it's kinda similar but the weather is not the same so gotta love l_a for the weather
9297,416,i see what you mean,
9298,416,why did you move to l_a, <tisk> family i was a child
9299,416,how easy was it for you to get used to living in l_a, it took a little adjustment but not hard
9300,416,that's good,
9301,416,what are some things you really like about l_a, um the weather um i can't think of anything right off the bat but i sure wouldn't wanna leave so my family is here so that's another reason why i wouldn't wanna leave
9302,416,mhm,
9303,416,what are some things you don't really like about l_a, traffic <laughter>
9304,416,i'm sure you can tell by my shoes i'm not much of a world explorer do you travel a lot, not really but i've traveled <tra> traveled a little bit yeah
9305,416,what do you enjoy about traveling, seeing new places different people the way they live their lives
9306,416,cool,
9307,416,i'd love to hear about one of your trips, <tisk> um i went to monterey california earlier last <la> or the middle of last year that was very nice
9308,416,what's one of your most memorable experiences, um it's a good question i'm not really sure uh there's probably
9309,416,okay, i can't think of anything right off the bat which makes me think uh it's kinda weird but <laughter>
9310,416,what did you study at school, astronomy
9311,416,that sounds interesting, yeah it was
9312,416,how did you decide to do that, <tisk> i don't know just kinda fell into it took a course liked it and then took some more and kinda just went down that path
9313,416,are you still working in that, no
9314,416,why, there's not much job opportunities so it's kinda limited
9315,416,that sucks, yeah it does <laughter>
9316,416,what's your dream job, um my dream job i would like to own a restaurant a nice a bar restaurant
9317,416,can you tell me about that, well i'd like to have something a little more upscale than most places you go to or at least in the area that i live in most places don't seem very kind of just seem like a dive bar just kind of worn out run down so something nice something different something creative something vibrant something for you know attracts a crowd
9318,416,uh huh, but it's probably costly so i don't know if it's really plausible <laughter>
9319,416,yeah,
9320,416,do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing, i'm definitely more shy but i can be outgoing when i'm comfortable with people but initially i'm pretty shy
9321,416,okay, <laughter>
9322,416,sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax, good idea um a lot of times i try to just lay back and you know do some deep breathing just kind of clear your mind or maybe just watch a movie listening to music is good reading a book kinda just takes your mind away
9323,416,mhm, relax
9324,416,how are you at controlling your temper, i've gotten much better at it <laughter> i used to have problems with that when i was younger but i'm i'm good i'm good with that now learned that you shouldn't react immediately to situations you should you know think before you speak that type of thing
9325,416,when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about, um my ex girlfriend when we broke up about three months ago <laughter>
9326,416,can you tell me about that, um we're relationship just wasn't doing very well so it just kind of was going down a predictable path and we just were arguing over the same old stuff and wasn't really it wasn't a memorable argument but it was it was an argument so that's all i can think of and i haven't really seen her since so i don't know that's what it is nothing special just a typical argument between two people who had grown separate
9327,416,how did you feel in that moment, frustrated
9328,416,yeah, like yeah i guess everybody kinda sees things in their own way and you know my way and my perspective is right and i'm sure her way was right too so trying to convince somebody that you know of your ideas or what you're thinking is more difficult than it is because everybody's kinda looking out for themselves
9329,416,uh huh, <tisk> but yeah
9330,416,tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently, mm that's a good example right there with the my girlfriend i didn't have to i could've reacted a little differently and not shown so much emotion um there's been times in my life where i've gotten into arguments with friends or something like that where you know or previous relationships where i probably shouldn't have reacted the way i did you know not that i did anything bad but just more of uh you know be more mature about it and not you know reveal your emotions so much or that type of thing
9331,416,mhm,
9332,416,tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make, <tisk> um <sigh> leaving my first girlfriend to go to school when i was eighteen this was a long time ago i went to school in san diego and i immediately wanted to come back so i kind of ruined our relationship and we're still friends and i wish i didn't do that
9333,416,what's something you feel guilty about, mm i feel like i can contribute more to my family and my friends i i think i could do better i i think i sell myself short so employment opportunities are hard to come by but if i could find a good job i'd be a lot more happy because i could provide for myself and others so not be so much of a burden to people around me
9334,416,yeah,
9335,416,it can be tough to find a good job these days, <tisk> yeah real difficult <laughter>
9336,416,tell me about your relationship with your family, it's good it's very good we're pretty open with each other and i see my mom and dad and my sister quite often so it's a good relationship i mean we we get along well could be i mean it's not it's not perfect but it's good
9337,416,that's good,
9338,416,yeah,
9339,416,how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep, <tisk> pretty easy i'm a good sleeper
9340,416,what are you like when you don't sleep well, um probably irritable there's it's harder to do tasks it's kind of like you feel like you're being strange or something because you don't have as much energy and
9341,416,mhm,
9342,416,how have you been feeling lately, good relatively well spring time always makes everybody feel well
9343,416,that makes sense,
9344,416,have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d, no not at all
9345,416,have you been diagnosed with depression, never
9346,416,tell me about the last time you felt really happy, <tisk> um really really i mean we all feel happy every day at some point but really happy <sigh> it's probably been a while um probably like superbowl sunday i was with all my friends we were having a good time so it's been probably like a month and a half or something when i was really really happy
9347,416,mhm,
9348,416,what are some things you wish you could change about yourself, i wish i was more i guess stuck to my goals and i wish i had better drive to succeed i don't know i usually settle for less so
9349,416,why, i don't know i i guess that's the calm demeanor part of me that's good and bad <laughter>
9350,416,mm, don't really matter i kinda live in the moment and then you kinda realize that five ten years have gone by and you should've done something
9351,416,yeah,
9352,416,tell me about a time when someone made you feel really badly about yourself, um i'm just gonna stick to that argument with my girlfriend <laughter> three months ago she made me feel pretty bad <laughter>
9353,416,okay,
9354,416,tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory, um i i don't know uh when i was when i was in high school i got into an argument with a friend and i drove my car too fast and it was an area that i didn't know and i hit a turn that i didn't know was coming and i crashed my car so i wish i didn't do that but that's a long time ago so it's not a big deal now <laughter>
9355,416,how did you feel in that moment, stupid <laughter> immature <laughter>
9356,416,who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life, <tisk> um my parents some of my close friends i have i have a good group of three or four friends that've been positive influences
9357,416,that's great, yeah
9358,416,how would your best friend describe you, mm a caring guy nice person good heart a little a little unmotivated needs to improve on certain aspects of his life to make himself better and uh passionate i guess passionate in a good and bad way <laughter> <laughter>
9359,416,can you tell me about that, well i care a lot and at the same time sometimes it gets the best of me
9360,416,can you give me an example of that, mm <tisk> sometimes you feel like you know you're doing more for your friends or somebody like that you're doing more than they deserve and you're not it's not being reciprocated so that's an example
9361,416,i see what you mean,
9362,416,is there anything you regret, yeah probably but i can't think of anything off the top of my head
9363,416,what advice would you give to yourself ten or twenty years ago, <tisk> um focus more on school because while you're young you have the ability to multitask and scrubbed_entry
9364,416,tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed, mm <tisk> i don't know really enjoyed i mean i do things everyday that i enjoy but really enjoyed i don't i don't know um i i i cleaned up a bunch of stuff from my room so it was nice to shed some old garbage so that that was alright but i don't know if i really enjoyed that but i felt content after it
9365,416,(laughter,
9366,416,what are you most proud of in your life, mm <tisk> not much it's i mean it's kinda sad i don't know uh <laughter> i think i could do better i feel like i'm an underachiever so not much i don't know
9367,416,what would you say are some of your best qualities, i'm very detail oriented organized i like to finish tasks um i care a lot you know i'm very caring um i have good intentions in mind i don't like to wrong people i don't like to lie because once you lie one lie leads to another so i don't like that
9368,416,yeah, but yeah that's that's about it
9369,416,okay i think i have asked everything i need to, <laughter> cool
9370,416,thanks for sharing your thoughts with me, right on have a good day

9381,417,how did you decide to do that, i think that it's a really important job um uh i feel like uh because there's kind of uh stigma i guess about talking about sex it leads to like a lot of unsafe sex and a lot of unplanned pregnancies so i feel like it's a very important job for the world <laughter>
9382,417,yeah,

9528,419,yeah,
9529,419,do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing, uh i consider myself more shy
9530,419,why, um in social situations i kind of feel uncomfortable um i'm not one to just go up to people and start conversations um if people come up to me of course i'll talk to them but i feel slightly awkward just kind of out of place at a party
9531,419,i see what you mean,
9532,419,what did you study at school, um i actually studied history
9533,419,awesome, <laughter>

9539,419,that's great,
9540,419,how are you at controlling your temper, um i used to be not very good at controlling it when i was a kid i would get mad um very easily and sometimes as an adult i still get angry easily but i've gotten a lot better at trying to think about things first before saying them and not having outbursts things like that
9541,419,when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about, um the last time i argued with somebody was probably about a week ago it was um my best friend and she actually she has kids i don't and for some reason she thought or thinks that i think i'm a better person than she is and because i went to school and she didn't and she's home with kids and you know i'm able to do more things um i don't think i've ever made her feel that i i and i definitely know i don't feel like i'm better than her but for some reason she accused me of that and we had an argument about it
9542,419,yeah,
9543,419,tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently, um well that situation i wish i had handled differently um because when she was talking to me she was very upset and i started off pretty calm just trying to reason with her and let her know that i certaintly didn't feel like i was better than her but towards the end of the conversation it just kinda turned into a yelling match between the two of us and i wish i had been able to just stay calm and maybe asked her to call me later once we calmed down instead of just continuing the argument
9544,419,hmm,
9545,419,how did you feel in that moment, um i was angry at first but once we hung up i felt really bad about the situation i felt that maybe i could've just let her let out all her feelings and then try to speak to her calmly um instead of yelling at her too
9546,419,i see what you mean,
9547,419,tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make, oh wow um that's a tough one i think um gosh i think one of the toughest <tough> hardest decisions i've had to make is breaking up with a boyfriend of seven years um although i knew that it was the right thing to do i was kind of hanging on to the fact that we had been together for so many years and i kinda felt by ending the relationship um i would've wasted those last seven years of my life it was a pretty tough decision to make but i realized that it was the best decision for me at the time and i'm actually glad i did because then i went on to meet um my husband
9548,419,aw, <laughter>
9549,419,that's great, thank you
9550,419,tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory, um well about i would say maybe fifteen years ago i was hanging out with a couple of friends at a club and they met some guys and um they invited us back to their place and i really didn't wanna go because i didn't know these people and i mean i knew their names and that's about it but my friends really wanted to go and i wasn't the one driving so i decided to just go along with them and back at their house um one of the guys actually pulled me into a room and tried i i got scared i yelled he tried to choke me and i thought i was gonna die right right there i thought he was gonna kill me but luckily one of my friends knocked on the door because she heard me scream and we left so it could've been a worse situation but i still think about it and wish that i could erase it from my mind
9551,419,yeah,
9552,419,that sounds really hard, it was
9553,419,tell me about your relationship with your family, um we have a pretty good relationship i am close to i have a sister and a brother um my sister is two years younger and my brother is two years older and we get along pretty well um my sister and i used to be best friends but then we grew apart and then um now we're actually closer i think than ever and i have a pretty good relationship with my parents um my dad still treats me like i'm a little kid sometimes <laughter> which annoys me
9554,419,(laughter, but i think we have a pretty good solid relationship
9555,419,that's good, yeah
9556,419,how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep, um <sigh> i usually wake up a few times throughout the night um so i think it's rare for me to sleep uh the whole night through ever um and i do feel a little like tired in the morning when i wake up it's hard i'm not a morning person definitely um so yeah it's kinda hard to get a good night's sleep
9557,419,why, um i don't know it i have a hard time falling asleep and then sometimes i have bad dreams or i need to get up to use the restroom um but yeah it i don't remember the last time i actually slept the whole night without waking up at least once
9558,419,how have you been feeling lately, um emotionally good um i'm actually on vacation right now from work so that's really nice um physically i feel good i haven't been to the gym in a while so that kinda makes me feel bad um 'cause i like working out um but health wise i'm good <laughter>
9559,419,okay,
9560,419,have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d, no
9561,419,have you been diagnosed with depression, no

9563,419,nice,

9610,420,when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about, oh yeah that doesn't make it seem that good <laughter> um last time i argued was over someone actually spitting out a racial slur towards my um wife
9611,420,oh no,
9612,420,how did you feel in that moment, angry upset hurt disrespected
9613,420,yeah, and especially when i went up there to treat the person actually i was treating 'em with dignity and respect and trying to help the person at first

9615,420,tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently, mm i had a chance in school to really go a lot further than i did and i let something very small and meaningless stop me in the pursuit of it

9617,420,could you have done anything to avoid it, now that i think back on it i could've done a whole lot to avoid it but i was just young and foolish

9628,420,why, because when somebody talks to you when they say something a certain amount of times and the tonage in they voice and the belief in their eyes if you say something so many times it's what really lies in your heart <sharp inhale> so you could say whatever through your mouth but it's what really is there

9783,422,whatever comes to your mind, well uh i would say last summer when um i think it was after a baseball game there was a group of us and we went uh to we went to have shabu shabu after the game and i don't know i think scrubbed_entry and i don't know it's it's it's kind of a tenuous friendship like mm she's a good friend in some ways and she's mm we're we're actually kinda distant in other ways so i i don't consider her um like someone that i would confide in and you know if any deep problems but um sometimes we just have she's very touchy and she doesn't have the same sense of humor i do so i think she had said some things to me during the night which mm kinda bothered me but mm you know i just kinda that's just how she is and then i guess i said some things that she felt were eh well she gets really offended easily i think <laughter> but um after that we didn't talk for a while but then we then one day she called me up and then we were friends again
9784,422,okay, but like she never she never confronted me
9785,422,tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make, hardest decision <sigh> uh it was leaving my ex-boyfriend
9786,422,how did you decide to do that, uh well it wasn't <sigh> it was a long time coming i mean i was thinking about it for like five years um you know he wasn't like beating me or anything he was a really good guy but we just had a lot of um we <w> we weren't always on the same wavelength and we did have a lot of like disagreements so i had thought about it and thought about it and we were already engaged but we had been together for a long time so i don't know uh i was always it was always on my mind like should i get married or should i not and then finally eh we were just always having um we were always what what's the word i'm looking for um we were just having these little snippy disagreements all the time and then one day we had one and i just decided that i was gonna leave and um i did
9787,422,that sounds really hard, it was really hard it was it was the hardest decision in my life and i can stay that definitively um and but i i think it was for the best
9788,422,that's good,
9789,422,tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently, <deep breath> <sigh> hmm um probably leaving my job for well to help my friend start a business in nevada and when i when i i really liked my job i mean it was it was pretty good um it was right over at the beach and when i told them that i was leaving then they offered me this huge raise and they offered me a a different position which was awesome and that was really stressful for me because um i'd already promised my friend <laughter> to leave i wouldn't have gotten the position you know offer if if it wasn't for her wanting me to come over there um it was really really stressful and i stressed over it for about three weeks until i actually left and um when i went over there like we had we had made agreements about how much they were gonna pay me and blah blah blah when i got there everything like she didn't remember telling me that i needed a certain amount and the other principals of the company were um you know the <th> it was a hard situation 'cause she had she had talked with me but they hadn't talked with me and they're like well that's too much and also they were a different religion and it was very strange i mean they were all one religion <laughter> i was i was surrounded by mormons and i i don't have anything against mormons but it was very different because eh
9790,422,(laughter, eh i was kind of an outsider there and then also the weather was just it was absolutely awful there <laughter> so i would say that's one decision it it's it just a a pivotal point in my life and i think that um i really wish i i had just stayed
9791,422,yeah,
9792,422,tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory, <laughter> um well if you're gonna erase something from my memory then <laughter> um i would probably say <sigh> my memory like really if if i could erase something from my memory what would i want to erase is that what you're saying
9793,422,uh huh, mm <sigh> can't really think of anything i mean even like that that bad decision that i made you know it it has value in it so <sigh> i can't really say that i would want something erased i mean maybe if i was like raped or something
9794,422,mm, and it was really <sigh> horrifying then i would but i don't

9805,422,okay,
9806,422,are they triggered by something, uh they're just triggered by the fact that my health is is not great and it makes it makes life really difficult but um i wouldn't say it's triggered by anything in particular

9943,424,tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make, the hardest decision i've ever had to make the hardest decision i've ever had to make was i was on my way to work as an enrollment counselor on a plane had a stroke was going to make an a connection and to get on the other plane to and then go to the hospital and a doctor was sitting behind me and he told me that i could not get on that plane because i might have another stroke that was a hard decision 'cause i was in dallas texas all by myself i did not i mean i was in there with an employee but i would be left all by myself 'cause my employees had to go on to montgomery alabama where we were headed and i had to make a decision should i stay or should i go but my life was in the balance so i made the decision to stay and go to the hospital but that was a hard one <sniffle>
9944,424,oh my gosh,
9945,424,how did you feel in that moment, ugh overwhelmed i mean here i am on my way to work you know i flew to different states every week and uh to help kids get get admitted into college and here i am on my way to work and i'm on a plane and i feel this weird feeling coming over the left side of my body and i say my prayers and i go to sleep and then when i wake up to get off the plane i can't remove my luggage from the overhead compartment which i did every week so i knew something was wrong it was it was when you to your life and the whole world in your hand and you don't know what's gonna happen next so it was very disturbing very traumatic and i you know you don't know what's happening to you it's so the weirdest thing riding to the hospital in a medical ambulance that was a weird experience
9946,424,yeah,
9947,424,i'm sorry, yeah but i'm here i you know i survived it the doctor told me nobody survives it a stroke on a plane and i survived so the universe wasn't finished with me yet
9948,424,mhm,
9949,424,yeah,
9950,424,how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep, you know what that's sometimes i have a little problem with it um sleeping a little bit sometimes i i get wired up <laughter> i get wired up just because i'm one of those real energetic persons and i have to finish what i set out to do and until i finish i can't go to sleep so sometimes it's hard for me to go to sleep other times i can lay down and just go but depends on what's going on in my head
9951,424,what are you like when you don't sleep well, um i'm sluggish um probably a little on edge but i try and keep a a upbeat personality i'm a real energetic person so i try to but you know if you're tired your body is still talking to you so
9952,424,uh huh,
9953,424,how have you been feeling lately, lately i've been feeling really well um except i've been having some problems because i have a um since i had the stroke i have nerve damage in my hand and in my face and so i just it's i thought it's been over a year since i had the stroke but i thought by now it would have gotten a little better and it hasn't but i'm so grateful to be alive that that is really minor <mi> minor compared to the bigger picture and i wasn't fortunately <for> fortunately my i didn't lose my facial structure or you know my face is not screwed up like a lot of people are i still can use my hands i still can shoot with my camera even though my left hand is is diminished in use but i can shoot with my right hand as a photographer so i can still keep doing my work um so you know i have to keep a good upbeat energy going on for me to keep for me to be successful

9959,424,that sucks, so that i can get well 'cause i wanna be a fulfilled human being and i wanna be totally and you know the system it'll be almost two years before i go for a hearing so that's kind of depressing to think after all the years i've been working since i was sixteen and it's taking me it's been over a year it was a year i had the stroke february two thousand twelve and we are now in march of two thousand thirteen and i won't have a hearing until september two thousand thirteen just to tell me if i get the disability or not that's been very depressing for me because i'm wondering where i lived off my savings in the last year and i got put my daughter through college she finished and now she's having to take care of me and she's still looking for a job and my life is kinda up in the air right now 'cause i'm wondering what comes next and so i'm just praying for guidance <sniffle>

10073,426,tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make, mm i'm not sure uh i don't really have a recollection of my hardest decision i've made in my life
10074,426,mm,
10075,426,when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about, um it was probably a few days ago with the girl i was talking to and i was arguing about her lack of communication and attentiveness yeah
10076,426,how did you feel in that moment, uh frustrated because um you know uh you you put in a certain amount of effort and you expect you know the same effort by the other person when you're in a relationship and at the same time when you when you have expectations sometimes you kinda set yourself up for failure so you know i guess i'm just learning
10077,426,yeah,
10078,426,tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently, there's a lot of situations i would've handled differently um probably the most recent was uh i had gotten into a physical <phy> a physical altercation with an inmate when i was incarcerated and that made me that's what sent me to prison and and i had to do a lot more time and um if i handled it differently i probably would've never went to prison i probably would've been home a lot sooner than i originally happen yeah
10079,426,tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory, mm there are several events i wish i could erase from my memory um probably uh my first girlfriend um she did something really uh extreme it wasn't necessary in my eyes and it and it cost <co> it could've cost me my life i think that that that's a recurring thought that i i wish i could completely erase from my memory along with the good memories as well um a few you few fights uh i guess you could say shoot outs um getting jumped getting robbed you know those things i think those inhibit me i guess to to explore certain areas of life that i'm not comfortable with so those are the feww things that it'd be nice if i could erase it completely
10080,426,yeah,
10081,426,that sounds really hard, yeah
10082,426,what's something you feel guilty about, <sigh> hurting people that didn't need to be hurt emotionally especially um a few women in my life or in my past um probably putting my mother through certain things that she didn't have to go through along with my close friends and family as well
10083,426,okay,
10084,426,tell me about your relationship with your family, um used to be rocky growing up but as i got older and matured and the certain experiences that i've been through kind of brought me closer to my family so now it's it it's pretty decent it's it's pretty decent
10085,426,that's great,
10086,426,that's great,
10087,426,who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life, mm i would say my mother um yeah my mother
10088,426,can you tell me about that, um well she she uh she had her share of experiences negative and positive um i admire her the struggles she's been through um she she she uh experienced difficult economic hardships growing up but that didn't stop her um from raising a son at a young age finishing school getting her master's and just just overall being a a good person and she also battled mental health issues as well and um probably not the best of family that she could've been raised with so she so she's kinda of like a a inspiration to to me and other people as well so i would say my mother
10089,426,yeah,
10090,426,how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep, mm it's not easy so yeah it's not easy
10091,426,why, i couldn't tell you i i i've always had sleeping issues um i usually just take uh like over the counter sleep medication or nyquil but it makes you drowsy the next morning so it's like it's a negative effect really
10092,426,mhm, yeah
10093,426,are they triggered by something, the medication <medi> i don't know shit i don't know but i just stopped taking it 'cause i didn't like feeling drowsy
10094,426,how have you been feeling lately, not good at all
10095,426,can you tell me about that, um yeah i mean i recently got released from prison not too long ago uh i'm older now and a lot more responsibilities and i feel like my life is not where it's supposed to be i feel like i could've made a lot more better decisions in my life you know sometimes feeling sorry for myself and just things that i've been through and the whole nine yards so yeah
10096,426,i'm sorry, it's all good
10097,426,there are always trade-offs in life aren't there, yeah so true
10098,426,have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d, yes
10099,426,how long ago were you diagnosed, <sniffle> about two and a half three years ago
10100,426,what got you to seek help, <deep breath> <sigh> myself i um i was i was just tired of not i don't know i guess school kind of made me seek help because i started to understand myself how my brain works um you know so i decided to seek help maybe to better my life yeah you could say that
10101,426,are you happy you did that, yes i am
10102,426,do you still go to therapy now, yes
10103,426,do you feel like therapy is useful, yes i do actually i do
10104,426,what sort of changes have you noticed since you've been going to therapy, mm better decision making um better tools to reflect on choices um how to control uh certain situations better yeah
10105,426,can you give me an example of that, um <sniffle> well instead of just always reacting on emotion no matter what kind of emotion it is i step back and and and i assess the situation you know to see what's what's the best way to to react towards the situation and by doing that it has made me more mature emotionally more mature and just has a positive outcome
10106,426,mhm,
10107,426,tell me about the last time you felt really happy, <laughter> um i was lying next to a beautiful woman who who cared about me and the feeling was mutual so that was probably the most happy
10108,426,how would your best friend describe you, oh my goodness spontaneous um outgoing sometimes a little crazy um fun that's about it

10580,432,mhm,
10581,432,that's good,
10582,432,do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing, i'm more shy but i'm forced to be outgoing because i you know you can't really get anything done being shy but given a choice i'd rather be um you know a little more pulled back <laughter> uh until i you know i i i feel like just the closest a safe path to go so that kinda curtails with my spirit of adventure sometimes i think
10583,432,i understand,
10584,432,can you give me an example of that, an example hmm well an example of what exactly you mean what aspect
10585,432,yeah, okay well example like uh traveling sometimes you wanna go to a particular place and it's uh something great happening there even though it's a great place but it's not such a cool place to go like take for instance like boston i used to go there a lot um now you know everybody i talk to is like a little bit nervous whether they should go there <laughter> you know to do you know uh um xxx you know have a great time you know i think it's because of all the disturbance that just happened kinda you know throws you off track a bit make you rethink um is that a good getaway spot still right now something like that you know
10586,432,yeah,
10587,432,i see, mhm
10588,432,sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax, mm uh me i huh i take walks i call up a friend we have tea or something you know
10589,432,how are you at controlling your temper, uh i think i pretty much gotten that under control
10590,432,when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about, mm eh uh it was probably something silly in a work situation that last about five minutes and oh pretty much haven't fought again i don't really dwell on negative things too much

10595,432,tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make, the hardest decision i've ever had to make was uh not hiring a good friend uh for a job that you know they weren't qualified for that's hard
10596,432,can you tell me about that, uh because you have to explain to them that it's not the friendship you're hiring it's their competence

10599,432,can you tell me about that, uh he just uh taught me how to you know uh overcome uh difficulties when i was growing up and how important it was to not give up uh and be able to see the bright side of any situation you face because it goes away you know if you hold in there long enough and i i found that to be true so

10752,434,uh huh,

10754,434,sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax, <laughter> i i mainly listen to music or i watch youtube write poetry um or i just close my eyes and just lay down and pretend like i can sing which i can't so <laughter> that's
10755,434,(laughter, and another thing i do is i eat ice cream <laughter>
10756,434,nice,
10757,434,how are you at controlling your temper, controlling my temper i'm very very good at it it depends on what it is i have to say that last time i lost my temper it was because i felt like somebody was um scaring my mother so i lost my temper but ninety nine times out of hundred i don't lose my temper don't like to raise my voice and i just like to be calm and cool and i like everybody to be comfortable i don't want anybody to be frightened or anything there's no reason for anybody to be frightened and for us to be angry and you know taking out our past frustrations out on people who had nothing to do with it i just believe that and and i believe um angry outbursts to be a link to um heart problems and high blood pressure so i definitely don't want that
10758,434,yeah,
10759,434,tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently, well i was just telling you about um it was it was my mother's husband and to tell you the truth um i could've handled that differently but when i seen the look in my mama's eyes of fear i just lost it and i snapped you know i told my mother uh like um i don't like this uh you need you need to take care of this because i'm don't know how long i can keep my composure as far as this 'cause i've been seeing this guy mistreat my mother mistreat my mother but that's her husband and so i kept my distance in their relationship but when i saw her having fear in her eyes that triggered a part of me um that i don't like very much because i know if i get angry i usually stay angry for a long time so i should've just left i should've just left and then went home and rested and got up in the next morning went to church but um yeah it we had a big time explosion and that created and that created a lot of damage for about six to nine months so yeah those six nine months i can't get back

11033,437,thanks for sharing your thoughts with me, oh you're welcome
11034,437,goodbye,
11035,438,hi i'm ellie thanks for coming in today i was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment i'm not a therapist but i'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you i'll ask a few questions to get us started and please feel free to tell me anything your answers are totally confidential are you ok with this, yes
11036,438,okay,
11037,438,so how are you doing today, i'm doing pretty good
11038,438,that's good,
11039,438,where are you from originally, i was born and raised right here in los angeles
11040,438,really,
11041,438,what are some things you really like about l_a, <sigh> um the weather um would be number one i also like the diverse uh cultures i like the fact that there's a lot of different things here you can do and there's a lot of opportunity here um not just for myself but for my kids and um i think it's really a great place to be when you're trying to establish a career go to school um learn about different people
11042,438,yeah,
11043,438,what are some things you don't really like about l_a, the traffic the cost of living um sometimes i think it's too big and i think the transportation system as far as the bus and trains um is long overdue they need to revamp it or you know add more buses and things like that just make it easier for people to get around on public transportation
11044,438,i see what you mean,
11045,438,i'm sure you can tell by my shoes i'm not much of a world explorer do you travel a lot, i travel when i can a little bit here and there i have not been overseas yet which is a goal of mine within the next couple of years so i've just traveled domestically i try to take at least one trip a year somewhere
11046,438,that's good,
11047,438,what do you enjoy about traveling, i just like the fact of getting on the plane and going places um going particularly somewhere i've never been and learning about that place you know like so if i'm going to d_c i really look forward to it 'cause it's a historic city you know things like that
11048,438,i'd love to hear about one of your trips, um my most recent trip would've been d_c <laughter> last year um i went to go visit a friend and i stayed about three <thr> i think three to four days and i got to see the capitol um he showed me around showed me all the you know historic landmarks and sites the white house the capitol building um i got to see a lot of other different uh government buildings and um it was it was a a good experience the irony was i had to fly on nine eleven and so that had me a little uneasy but once i was in the plane up in the air i was okay and it was all good and once i was back home i was like yes but i i i miss the trip and i look forward to going back
11049,438,nice,
11050,438,what's one of your most memorable experiences, um attending uh my friend's wedding she had a destination wedding in hawaii um actually maui that was actually two three three years ago three years ago in august and um i've been trying to get back ever since and i wanna take my kids and i just love it there and i actually kinda look forward to to moving there one day
11051,438,tell me about your kids, um i have three sons um thirteen-year-old twins boys and my youngest is also a boy he's eight they um all have birthdays in june the twins are june ninth and my baby is june fourth and so they're just a few days apart but five years apart technically and they're just super super typical boys active all over the place hormones puberty um so it's actually an interesting time because you know the the two older boys are going through puberty um they're teenage years um my youngest um still trying to figure some things out for himself you know doing that transition stage of eight to nine years old so he'll be nine in june and then my oldest will be fourteen so it's a challenging time for me as well
11052,438,what's the best thing about being a parent, just the joy of watching what you put into being a parent every day and seeing how just with love and nurturing and um the right and you know well i can't say proper development but just with you know love and nurturing how a um baby grows into a toddler into you know a young boy to a teenager and then into a young man and so that experience alone has been rewarding just watching my sons grow up and go through these different stages and seeing how they have developed and you know seeing some of the things that they're going through now that so reminiscent of my teenage years and um it's just it's very rewarding and um actually i look forward to maybe even being a foster parent later down the line when they're older and off in college 'cause i really love children and giving back
11053,438,aw,
11054,438,that's so good to hear,
11055,438,what's the hardest thing about being a parent, um mm there's probably a couple of things but i would just say um for me being a single parent is um the financial um well i would say that along with some of the emotional with <w> with them having um to bear the brunt of the responsibility of just child child rearing um you know the just the everyday things of what you have to deal with the uh sometimes when you're just tired you don't wanna be bothered or you're trying to do things for yourself you have to be reminded that oh okay i gotta cook or i have to go pick my son up or i have to take him to baseball practice uh this one want to go over here um this one is acting moody and you know just those those types of challenges um as well as the financial and you know making sure you know you're able to put food on the table you're paying your rent and you know you're keeping up with the day to day and that's those two are probably the hardest things um for me to deal with
11056,438,yeah,
11057,438,how do you cope with them, well i just um i take it day by day i just put one foot in front of the other and um i'm extremely spiritual so i just rely on god and pray a lot and meditate um if i see i need a little help if if you know i'm i'm i'm not above asking for help so sometimes if i have to reach out to people or you know see what other resources are out there to help me you know i try to do that and so for me right now my biggest challenge is just trying to go back to school to put myself in a better um economic situation so i can continue to provide for them comfortably
11058,438,mhm,
11059,438,what did you study at school, um i studied communications actually i was a um journalism public relations major with a minor in sociology and now i'm studying business <laughter>
11060,438,what made you decide to do that, i just thought that you know um there would be more opportunities for me with business um as far as jobs and then i you know have a desire to go to graduate school so i just figured in the long run it was a better um it would put me in a better position give me more opportunities um with the communications it's a little limited and especially as you get older um the fields of t_v reporting and things like that um are kinda become you know harder to obtain so i just thought eh i would go into something more realistic and um you know but uh i like both fields i really do i like communicating writing reading talking as you can tell and um so we'll see
11061,438,what's your dream job, um <laughter> a couple probably but i would say ultimately would be traveling like working as like a travel writer um going to different destinations um trying different foods out um writing about different people cultures um learning and living you know uh about those different people and cultures living <l> living amongst <am> amongst the you know the the people there and um being interactive with the children and stuff like that so i kinda hope to be able to do that one day but yes um it it would be something along those lines and then the fallback would be a counselor social worker something in that area if i could encompass all three hopefully i can i i would like to do that
11062,438,mhm,
11063,438,do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing, um that's actually a hard question probably because i initially grew up very shy and um not so much shy as i am reserved now um but not conservative but just reserved and you know when i go somewhere i'm checking everything everybody else out and then once i become comfortable or acclimate to the situation then i'm like okay you know i warm up to the to the situation or the people but i'm also friendly i can be very friendly and outgoing i like to talk um you know i seem like a chatterbox but i'm not really so usually if i'm in a big space with a whole lot of people i don't like to be the center of attention <atten> attention i can attach myself to one or two people and you know become friendly with them but i i overall i am a open friendly person
11064,438,mhm,
11065,438,sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax, <laughter> um for me um it it could be something as simple as just unplugging everything all electronics and just sitting for a few moments meditating praying or reading a good spiritual scripture um if i'm able to i like to go for a good massage maybe get a facial um you know things that will i kinda like the physical part part of it i like massages things that really release tension um and if not then just like i said just sitting at home reading and praying or i like the beach i love the beach so sometimes i drive and go sit by the beach i like <li> also like to just maybe go and have lunch by myself or get a mani pedi or maybe go window shopping you know things like that
11066,438,okay,
11067,438,how are you at controlling your temper, mm pretty good sometimes i'm just like grr i don't really have so much a issue with the temper as i am i just i'm more impatient unfortunately a lot of times with people and you know situations so i just can become really irritated or irritable um quite agitated especially if it's that time of the month for me i just lose patience um outside of that i'm actually pretty good i try to be very you know conscious of where i'm at and be very patient with people especially if i could see that the person is like if if they're a new <n> a new checkout person at the the counter or cashier i do try to be i do try to be patient and understanding 'cause i would want that you know if it were me i would want someone to extend that to me
11068,438,mm, um you know with my kids sometimes you know it's this it works both ways too once it's that time of the month i'm just like ugh just leave me alone um or i might have a short temper or a short fuse so i am conscious of it i try to be aware of it and and try to monitor it but you know like anybody i'm human and there are times or i have my days or moments when i could just like ugh go off and just lose it
11069,438,yeah,
11070,438,when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about, um <sigh> well i haven't really had it not per se an argument but there's been a ongoing thing with american express so i would say because it was not a personal contact but a company i eh we it it really was an argument but uh you know i i had some um issues with american express i had to call in about on i think saturday and i kept um i wasn't getting the response i expected and so i would get the whole contact the call was just back and forth very frustrating and i was upset and you know the rep was trying to overtalk me then i was trying to overtalk her so you <y> you know i don't know if you would consider that an argument but i would definitely say that's the last time when you know i just kinda like reached my boiling point to say the least and was really upset and eh that <th> that was the closest you know to an argument and then i had to call back this morning that one didn't really escalate to an argument but it was um a a a tense exchange for a minute or two
11071,438,i see,
11072,438,tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently, probably the most recent contact and that would've been the one on saturday with american express um or actually it was on sunday yeah and um i know the person was trying to help me but you know when you you're constantly being told different things and i've had to call in about five or six times about the same situation and it not be resolved it just takes you there so um just i kept raising my voice said some things i shouldn't had um and just was more so allowed myself to lose control of the contact i like to really feel in control of the contact and so um it just took me there my blood pressure was raised <clears throat> excuse me and that was just a kind of a mess for a while for like maybe thirty minutes or an hour after that just irritable and agitated and upset and and so i always try to you know go back and pull from those and you know do my own sense of feedback and see how i could you know handle things differently but that's one i i definitely wish i could've kept my cool and been more level-headed and and not really raised my voice and you know um been more polite
11073,438,okay,
11074,438,tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make, <sigh> mm well i've probably have had a couple but <clears throat> probably the most is a situation years ago when i just had my sons and they probably my twins they were probably about two and i was in a situation with their father again and became pregnant and um it just was not a good time and he pretty much you know was not comfortable with me having another child at the time and um i wasn't comfortable with having another child either but wanted to keep the baby but he put me under so much stress and you know kind of i wanna say really pushed me into having terminating the the pregnancy and that's always stayed with me and i've always missed that pregnancy that child i think about that that baby or what could've been i try not to hold any um anger or resentment towards him or anybody about it but i know deep down inside secretly if i had it to do all over again i would've just i would've kept the baby and moved forward so that would've been probably the hardest especially emotionally i could deal with a lot and i have dealt with a lot you know um being unemployed or you know lot of financial problems but that to me was the hardest
11075,438,i'm sorry to hear that, thank you
11076,438,have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d, no mm mm
11077,438,have you been diagnosed with depression, no
11078,438,how have you been feeling lately, um okay you know um i was laid off in december so i've been constantly trying to do things to you know get um back on my feet so that's been a little tough i've had i've had to face a lot of challenges and dealing with that and issues with child support and trying to find another job and going back to school so i my <m> my range of emotions have just have been just that a range and a very good friend of mine now who we both started off you know in the same place um about five years ago well she's been able to move forward and um go on with her life and now she's graduating in next month from u_s_c with her master's in social work so i'm feeling a little envious of that and i have been for like the past year but more so recently although i've very very happy for her you know and she's a good person and she deserves it but xxx of course deep down inside i wish it was me so that too has kinda been bothering me
11079,438,i understand, well i'm really good with um people i communicate well i like to talk i'm really good with children that's why i would like to teach or be a counselor um although i haven't not really tapped into it i know i'm a very creative person um i know i write pretty good um i could possibly be a creative writer but i know i'm very creative so if given the opportunity i know i could tap into that and really develop those skills something like with maybe songwriting um fiction writing um but probably like interior decorating anything artistic just anything 'cause i love music i love the arts i love drama i love plays um i'm not a big fashion buff but i do love fashion and makeup and stuff like that so um i think those would are are my strong points as well as just getting along with people i know i would make a great counselor people my friends come to me all the time i have a good ear for listening i'm a great mediator and i know how to because i've been through a lot and one of my friends called me the voice of reason the one that's actually graduating from s_c but um i know i'm like light years ahead of a lot of people when it comes to insight and wisdom and i don't know if it has to do with you know having older parents myself or how i grew up or i had i had very traditional southern parents um who instilled a lot of great values in me or if it has anything to do with my astrological sign i'm a pisces but um i'm i'm really good with people just you know period you know like i said i have my moments but i i know if it if it's something i could go into and develop i would do well

11101,439,i'd love to hear about one of your trips, uh let me start with uh well try boston i had never been to boston before and when i went um i was able to look at the historical uh the buildings and i went to um uh i saw um um eh the lake charles and the and the boats and stuff and it it was just it was a good experience and um there's another place i went to i took a ferry and it and i my mind went on blank on it um god i can't even think of it right now um but other than that uh new orleans i've been to new orleans i didn't go to the mardi gras it's just i don't like to go and it uh to mardi gras when they have a lot of people um i just went on a off season uh i enjoyed that and i've been to atlanta georgia and i have taken a cruise uh i've went to the caribbeans and i took the mexico cruise uh i my next cruise i'd like to go to is alaska because i want to be able to see uh certain areas that we haven't destroyed yet as far as the environmental
11102,439,that's great,
11103,439,do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing, um i'm outgoing as far as uh going places i don't have a problem um eating alone um i don't have a problem meeting people um i'm only shy in conversing back and forth to a stranger <laughter>
11104,439,sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax, oh i have a favorite thing uh i like to go on the internet and i like to do sweepstakes i'm a a person that loves to try to enter in a lot of contests and i've been very successful since i was a kid i've won a lot of sweepstakes and uh in the evening time uh i find like a hour of time and i just go online and just eh i'm so good at it i know just about exactly the right time to even enter 'em i usually try to enter 'em before midnight when everybody else is sleep so it's been successful for me
11105,439,what's one of your most memorable experiences, um getting married and having my children <laughter>
11106,439,aw, mm
11107,439,tell me about your kids, i have a twenty-seven-year-old son and i have a thirty-one-year-old son um both of 'em uh well one of 'em's married the other one's not and i just not too long ago became a grandmother so i have one grandson and uh my uh son he uh works for the county of los angeles as a conveyance <co> a property conveyance conveyance examiner and the other one is a computer engineer so and i've been married for thirty three years
11108,439,mhm, and um basically uh marriage pretty strong
11109,439,that's so good to hear,
11110,439,do you find it easy to be a parent, you know what if you build a foundation with your children and have a good relationship with them and talk to 'em and find out what's going on and tell 'em that you love them uh my son i've taught them all the time when they went out the door i love you and even today when they'll call me and hang up they say mom i love you you always have to give them that that um good feeling when they leave the door that you care and uh i i've never had to go to <t> to <t> eh to any jail to get 'em out um they've been pretty obedient i mean boys will be boys but um i never had any problem as far as uh them getting into any serious trouble and i'm very proud of that especially with boys i don't know how it would've been with a girls maybe a little different but <laughter> with boys i have to say they were pretty obedient and they respect the law
11111,439,yeah,
11112,439,(laughter,
11113,439,what's the best thing about being a parent, uh the best thing is watching them grow and become parents themselves and see what they learn basically from you and um i've watched my son like i said i just a recent grandmother and i watch him how he handles his son and it's it seems like he's learned a lot from his foundation that he learned at home on how to handle his son to be responsible to go to work every day and he knows that hey i got a wife i have a son and it's my job to make sure that i keep a roof over their heads so it pays off
11114,439,that's great, and i i basically he treats her well
11115,439,what are some ways that you're different as a parent than your parents, um my mother was more stricter on me <laughter> uh my my my parents um for some unknown reason i i guess because i my sister and i we're the girls they they weren't strict on the boys but they were more strict on the girls so they didn't let us go to a lot of places and then my parents also they weren't type that liked to travel and i used to look at them and say no i'm not gonna be like them i'm gonna travel i'm not gonna just stay home i i mean i mean <me> there's nothing wrong with 'em because they found love at home <laughter> and did things at home but they never really traveled anywhere and my mom used she was afraid of planes for one and i used to try to talk her into get on a plane and go somewhere and she said oh i'm gonna go here i'm going to go there but she never did she died she never did do <d> do any travel so i've made up for her and uh i i want to do something different and that's to to travel more than and be more out there i was more of a social butterfly my mother was a not a social butterfly so i made up for it
11116,439,okay,
11117,439,how are you at controlling your temper, i think before i speak and then i am the type of person also to um i take on other people's feelings before i um blurt out the wrong thing i try to uh analyze the situation first before <bef> because sometimes you can put your <yo> open your mouth too soon and you can put yourself in something that you may not be able to get out of
11118,439,yeah,
11119,439,when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about, um <laughter> it's probably something about my husband did <laughter> oh he <h> i know what it was it's about uh well probably over some construction <cons> new construction that my husband is working on on our house uh we had a disagreement on that um men have their own way of doing things and um i had told him not to use a certain uh eh person to work on our house but because of the personal relationship he has with this person he went on ahead and now he sees all the downfalls and he didn't listen and so i didn't say i told you so but i guess he can tell by my facial expression that uh he he'd have done wrong and i told him i said look you're losing money and it became one problem after another so now all the construction thing is up in the air right now 'cause he knows he has done wrong and uh but he doesn't wanna face the fact that well he knows it but he doesn't wanna really face the fact so he says look it's my project no it's our project so uh eh that that's one of the biggest arguments what we're having right now um that i can think of that's recent
11120,439,how did you feel in that moment, i felt that he <h> he <h> he didn't really listen to me and he more so looked at uh a cheaper economical way that he can get this done without going through the proper ways 'cause i told him that um you need to do your research i'm the type of person i do my research before i jump into something i i i try to dot my i's and cross my t's but my husband he's not like that he's like oh i can get this person can do this project for x amount of money and he's a good friend of mine so i don't care i mean is he licensed he doesn't look at all that stuff he's he just jumps into it <laughter>
11121,439,right, which cost him some extra money unnecessary money that he spent when and then i mean it was a lot of money and so i was really very upset yesterday and i was very upset about it because
11122,439,that sucks, it was just wasted money that we could've saved 'cause we wind up doing the same thing all over again
11123,439,yeah, and it didn't make any sense
11124,439,tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently, um i retired early um i was very fortunate to retire at age fifty i retired in two thousand and two i was working for the state of california um as a disability analyst and what happened was i was able the reason why i was able to retire so early because i'd been working since i was eighteen and i had like thirty one and a half years of service and what was so nice about it that only needed <n> needed to vest in like ten years in my health insurance so i was able to get full health insurance but the only thing about it when you retire i was with calpirg and i don't know if you're familiar with calpirg but um we we have a excellent retirement system and since i had been working with them so long um i didn't get the full percentage i should've stayed 'til i was fifty five but i got out at fifty and i didn't get the full amount but that's okay um eh i i found myself going back doing a little part-time job because of the economical reason and then i have wantitis <laughter> so um i think that was the kind of mistake i did i should've kinda waited 'til i was fifty five than fifty but i look at it now as far as the health insurance i really benefited because of the rising cost of the health insurance have went up and i don't i pay very little money so i think that over uh negates the uh uh uh the money that i receive
11125,439,yeah,
11126,439,tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make, um let me see the hardest it's probably when my mom died 'cause uh i'm not used to anybody dying and my mother um died in ninety nine of uh non-hodgkin lymphoma and i i xxx putting her funeral together um my brother and sister we never we would never face anybody dying or putting a funeral together and all the responsibility <responsi> because i am the eldest it was put in me and i'm like oh my god what do i do xxx and so um i was kinda like left out there trying to find her insurance policy 'cause i had asked her to make sure she put everything in order and she never got to it so the hardest thing was going through her house and trying to get all the stuff together and finding things you know i myself i keep my things organized but um for some unknown reason she didn't have hers organized and i think that was the hardest and knowing how much i had to pay 'cause i had to come out of pocket on some of my stuff and unfortunately my mom <laughter> this is interesting she had one little small barrel insurance but she had million dollar of accident insurance and she didn't die of course with with accident she had a medical condition so that was something so we had to pay for the whole just about everything
11127,439,that sounds really hard, yeah it was it was but and now i can handle i i i um <laughter> this will sound weird but um since that i've learned from that so i have made it available for my children that my husband and i we got together and we wind up getting our insurance uh uh uh uh policy xxx not insurance policy but um what do you call the um barrel insurance we had that and it just we've had it for mm many many years so it's almost paid but xxx ten years it'll pay for everything um the plot and everything and uh another thing that i did i've even written my own obituary i know that sounds weird so my son make one phone call that's it i don't want them to go through what i went through and my husband agreed that's the one thing we did agree on
11128,439,that makes sense, and um he said he don't want anybody to to have any problem uh people coming in and telling 'em what to do it's already written we did a living trust i mean it's nothing they can do but make one phone call
11129,439,mhm, and that's it
11130,439,how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep, i have no problem sleeping i sleep very <laughter> well pretty good
11131,439,how have you been feeling lately, um i've been a little tired but that's only because of physical condition um i have i found i have vitamin b deficiency and vitamin d xxx deficiency so it's more physical but not in the mental
11132,439,how do you cope with them, um exercise walk walking more so
11133,439,have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately, no not really
11134,439,have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d, no
11135,439,have you been diagnosed with depression, no
11136,439,tell me about the last time you felt really happy, i'm basically happily all the time i'm mm more so i'm making other people happy i get more phone calls of people want inspiration about things uh uh when they have projects they working on and i try to encourage them uh and it makes me feel good when they hang up and say you know hey i really appreciate your input um thanks and then they i'll i'll follow up on 'em and see how they're doing
11137,439,that's so good to hear,
11138,439,how would your best friend describe you, oh uh resource person i've been um described as a resource person from my supervisor to from my friends because i'm the type of person i research everything i get into just about i just don't  xxx dive into any situation i try to look up information uh some i know we have the technology here uh that you can get everything on the internet but also go back to the old school like like even finding this place i mean i did the map google but also i love the thomas brother i'm never gonna give up my thomas brothers map yellow pages you'd be surprised i don't give up my yellow pages so there's certain little things that i don't really let go i know we have technology but sometimes you know you'd be surprised that you can go around and find a whole lot of stuff that even though technology gives <gi> you have it right at your finger but you can find things and and they say i'm more of a resource person and most people come to me just to to look up things and i get that that that spunk about it because i like to look for stuff and find it
11139,439,uh huh, and that gives me satisfaction
11140,439,what are some things you wish you could change about yourself, uh i wish i can uh um stop going up and down on my weight <laughter> i'll lose weight i'll go on this big diet before the summertime and and then by christmas time i'm i have a what they call a yo-yo weight problem and if i can stop binging and making food my friend um i think that's just a nervous disorder i just <ju> i like to eat and um but also i don't like to be overweight either 'cause i have plenty of beautiful clothes at home and i can't get 'em xxx on right now so i know i say if i'm gonna go on this binge and try to lose weight for the summertime so i can get into those some nice clothes so it's mm mostly uh not happy with my weight that's it yeah
11141,439,mhm,
11142,439,is there anything you regret, i'm sorry didn't hear you
11143,439,is there anything you regret, um no not really i regret <laughter> that i can't stay skinny <laughter> i can't lose i mean i can lose the weight but i i regret not being able to keep it i i fall back on putting the weight back on
11144,439,what advice would you give to yourself ten or twenty years ago, um let's see xxx ten or twenty years ago mm i would've saved a little bit more money before i retired <laughter> and uh xxx uh basically um putting away more money before i retire instead of retiring too early
11145,439,what are you most proud of in your life, most proudest is of my life um meeting a lot of people that came in my life uh i got good friends i still have fifteen of the best friends that i went to elementary school and in very rare you could find anybody can walk around and say they have the same fifteen group of friends we were in a sorority together went to college together lived in the same neighborhood and matter of fact we just had um well all of us had our sixty year birthday and our our high school group we put together a sixty year birthday reunion and here all fifteen of us with exception of one we're all alive and healthy and we keep in contact so i think uh it's basically keeping the same friends i think eh we're gonna probably outlive each other <laughter>
11146,439,okay i think i have asked everything i need to, okay
11147,439,thanks for sharing your thoughts with me, you're welcome
11148,439,goodbye,
11149,440,hi i'm ellie thanks for coming in today i was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment i'm not a therapist but i'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you i'll ask a few questions to get us started and please feel free to tell me anything your answers are totally confidential are you ok with this, yes

11153,440,where are you from originally, um i was born in east los angeles and
11154,440,really, yes
11155,440,what are some things you really like about l_a, um the freedom to explore outdoors and with different um weather temperature <temp> you know with weather <clears throat> temperature and climates to go skiing or to the beach maybe in the same day
11156,440,mhm, i like that
11157,440,what are some things you don't really like about l_a, um mm i think probably the overcrowding um and the smog
11158,440,i see what you mean,
11159,440,i'm sure you can tell by my shoes i'm not much of a world explorer do you travel a lot, mm not not frequently but i have
11160,440,what do you enjoy about traveling, meeting other people and learning about their environment and their cultures
11161,440,i'd love to hear about one of your trips, sure um the last trip i've taken outside of here was to italy and um that was my second time being there and i enjoyed it more this time because um i knew what i wanted to see when i came back and um and i was better prepared for italians and their culture i felt i wasn't as uh you know i was just better prepared i thought for that trip
11162,440,what's one of your most memorable experiences, um <clears throat> that would be um being in the countryside and seeing a very tiny house in the midst of acres and acres and acres of grapes was just magnificent
11163,440,wow,
11164,440,what did you study at school, um human development
11165,440,how did you decide to do that, um <clears throat> i actually didn't decide at first to do that i started school with the intent of being a lactation consultant and um i went to a program in which you could get a degree as well as get your license to become a lactation consultant and through the process i learned that um i had to do a long internship without pay and at the time <t> and i miss i had a family so i had to make a different <diff> a career choice quickly and um so the college offered human development as a major and i um just went right in and used my used <u> used my units that i had already acquired towards that particular major and and i'm happy with it
11166,440,that's good,
11167,440,are you still working in that, um currently no i stay at home i have a little one uh well he's not so little i'm preparing to go back to work um in the meantime i design jewelry
11168,440,nice,
11169,440,tell me about your kids, well i have three children um i have a almost four year old and then i have two older children seventeen and twenty three
11170,440,do you find it easy to be a parent, no
11171,440,what's the best thing about being a parent, um that your children the the love <sigh> from them and for them is unconditional
11172,440,what's the hardest thing about being a parent, all the stages that they go through they're stages all the time for every age <laughter> and then everybody in my household is all different because they're different ages
11173,440,like what, so
11174,440,yeah,
11175,440,what are some ways that you're different as a parent than your parents, um i think i'm probably more in tune with those different stages that's why it makes me crazy um and i think that my parents the time that my parents were parents it was just kinda like you know is she fed is she dressed she has a house i mean a roof over her head and we're doing great as parents and we love her and so it wasn't um there wasn't too much i felt that that parents thought about in terms of that in terms of parenting in that way and like today you know there's books for every age every year month you know <clears throat> and um so i think it difference differs in that way
11176,440,mhm, tremendously
11177,440,how close are you to your family, very close <clears throat>
11178,440,that's good,
11179,440,do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing, outgoing
11180,440,why, mm i don't i don't um feel uninhibited <u> uninhibited i feel a little you know confident to talk to people i probably talk more than i need to <laughter>
11181,440,uh huh,
11182,440,sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax, um <clears throat> i bead i <clears throat> do i design jewelry that's what i do to relax
11183,440,that's great,
11184,440,how are you at controlling your temper, i'm pretty good i i well i think i um try not to not to um feel or let others know what my emotions are when i'm upset um which is not good 'cause if i don't do anything with them then i know that at some point it's gonna come out and um yeah that that's uh something i have to work on
11185,440,yeah, like exercising or something
11186,440,when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about, um <clears throat> it was my husband and it was about um he asked me whether i thought about cheating ever in our marriage on him
11187,440,how did you feel in that moment, uh really tired of talking about that same topic
11188,440,can you tell me about that, um well it came it spawned from <f> from a client of my husband's who's a female and she shared with him that she'd been cheating on her husband for like a year because she resented him for many things and um <clears throat> and so he took that information and came home and decided to ask me if i ever thought about it and what made me think about cheating and he knows that i've been resentful of him and did that make me feel like it did that make me want to cheat or did i think about cheating <clears throat> and um <sigh> i we've had this conversation a lot of times and uh i mean not just that but i don't know just about cheating in general and um so i just said what i normally said normally say is that i haven't um cheated and that i did think about that when we were first together and uh but it was just a mere thought and um and then his response was i know that if we cheated on each other we would never tell one another and that just kinda <sigh> i guess irritated me i was really bothered by that and i just started thinking you know we're having this conversation yet again and why are we having this conversation <laughter> are you the one that's cheating and so that's how that that went into that um argument i mean it wasn't ayelling <y> yelling i mean it was part conversation and part texting
11189,440,that sounds really hard,
11190,440,how do you cope with them, um <sigh> not talking at all <laughter>
11191,440,okay,
11192,440,tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently, um <sigh> mm pretty much any situation that involves my children and if i've yelled because i really don't like if i came to the point where i've had more of yelled it bothers me because um i was yelled at a lot and i just feel bad about that and i try really hard to not handle any kind of situation that involves my children no matter how upset i might get and result in in yelling
11193,440,okay,
11194,440,tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make, hmm that would probably be whether to keep a pregnancy or not
11195,440,can you tell me about that, yeah yeah i um i was just talking about it yesterday actually and um oh i was pregnant and i had wanted i wasn't married yet and i had wanted to be married and but i just didn't think that i it was the right time for me and um i had pretty much made up my mind that i was not going to keep that pregnancy but i made the decision by myself and when my partner found uh discovered that i was pregnant he said that he very much wanted to have a child and wanted to marry me and so that decision was quite hard because i felt obligated to do so and felt super guilty to not and <drops microphone> oops and uh this is on correctly um hang on this ear piece is falling there we go that was probably the hardest decision actually you know what no i wouldn't say that's the hardest decision i ever had to make i'm sorry the hardest decision that i had to make in my life was whether or not <clears throat> um the hospital should um unplug the life or um life support machine for my father or not that was the hardest decision
11196,440,what made you decide to do that, um because i knew that the quality of life he wanted for himself was more than that and to have been um to resort to the situation that he was in not capable of doing anything at all either speaking for himself um was beyond it who he was and i just couldn't see him like that anymore and he would be a vegetable i was told so i agreed to um resort that
11197,440,i'm sorry to hear that,
11198,440,how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep, not hardly ever
11199,440,why, <laughter> too many things running on my mind um and pretty much um mostly on the weekends because my older kids are out and about with their friends uh even though i know that they're gonna come <co> i mean i'm constantly worried about uh how they are when they come home and so i really can't fall asleep on the weekends most of the time but um and you <y> sometimes it's just been so many days of not getting a good night's sleep i'm just exhausted <ex> exhausted i pass out but it's hard
11200,440,how have you been feeling lately, very stressed
11201,440,can you tell me about that, mm my son is is um has been uh in dealing with some legal issues and um currently is incarcerated and uh it's been really hard
11202,440,have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately, yes i've been probably very short moody irritable
11203,440,are they triggered by something, well i often think about a lot of things that aren't even happening <laughter> my mind just goes from one point a to point b and i don't even know how i got there um you know it's interesting uh yeah

11343,442,what's one of your most memorable experiences, <laughter> uh arkansas little rock where i had to get into a uh you might wanna say a a altercation with the rednecks down there because as as you know um i'm african american and down there they're very prejudiced you know they're the uh uh southern uh uh uh which what were the rebels uh not rebels but uh what were they uh confederates they still have this uh uh tendency of thinking blacks or any other culture besides whites aren't uh valuable people
11344,442,oh no, yeah so it i had a incident down there where it actually turned into a shoot out but i'm okay
11345,442,okay,
11346,442,do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing, a little of both it it depends on it depends on the time on the period it depends on what mood i'm in at the time you know i can be outgoing 'cause i do uh like to go to  nightclubs and listen to live music live bands and i know like i said i uh i did some entertainment before so at clubs i'm more outgoing in social events more shy

11352,442,mhm,
11353,442,tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently, uh well it's it's probably it's no one no no situation actually can be i feel uh at the time when you when you deal with a situation at any particular time there's probably always a better way to handle it after the fact but uh i would say back in the day back in the eighties when me and my  wife broke up i think i could've handled that one better because i was younger more hot tempered and more irrational so i could've handled that one better yes
11354,442,what made you decide to do that, what the uh uh the way i broke the way i handled that situation

11499,444,sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax, um i have a actual fish tank um at my house and i i do the the same thing and i do that with my children when they get upset um the i sit them in front of the fish tank and it's very relaxing um i also try and meditate um i try and and just sit down and be quiet um and gather my thoughts um i like to read and um or sometimes i i walk or i'll take my dog for a walk
11500,444,how are you at controlling your temper, <sigh> i wish i could say i was good at it but usually i um i tend to have outbursts every once in a while um when things are getting too chaotic at my house um and i'm feeling very underappreciated i will have a burst of anger
11501,444,has that gotten you in trouble, yeah my husband doesn't appreciate that um and i i i've never done it at work or in a social situation but at home with my family i've done it and then instead of um recognizing that i'm upset about it my husband tends to get mad at me for being mad and then that escalates and uh sometimes i just end up walking out the door or going to my room
11502,444,how do you cope with them, hmm i'm sorry
11503,444,how do you cope with them, um i i usually after i have an outburst and i isolate myself for a little bit i can come back relaxed and deal with the situation in a more calm manner
11504,444,how hard is that, um sometimes it's very hard but i i i've gotten to the point where i know just to stop and and get myself out of there and and go take some deep breaths um and then really try and figure out what i'm feeling
11505,444,mhm, why i'm being angry why why am i being um so tense and then be able to verbalize that
11506,444,tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently, um well i i it happens a few times when i start getting i've had a very tense day um and things haven't gone right um i tend to have outbursts in the kitchen while i'm  making dinner and the kids are all home and they're asking me questions about their homework or they're turning on the t_v or and my husband's uh uh bothering me about things that i just don't need to think about right then and one time i just said okay everyone out of the kitchen leave me alone get out just let me finish dinner and nobody would and i just it just had more pressure building up and building up and i actually took one of the pots and just banged it against the stove <laughter> really hard to just like get people to pay attention to what i was saying it actually made a dent in my stove <laughter> um which is still there
11507,444,(laughter, um so that that i i should have um walked out sooner and taken my deep breaths before i did that
11508,444,tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make, um it was probably when i was pregnant with my first child um i wasn't married um <tisk> i had a very good friend um oh i was i was thirty two at the time so i was uh you know i wasn't young i think if i was younger i probably would have decided to have an abortion but at that point in my life i'm like okay i'm i'm going to have this um and i had um i i got pregnant by the man i actually married and still married to um but we'd only been dating like three months and i was living with a a good friend of mine who i had been in the peace corps with um and she and so i didn't know this guy very well um i didn't know if we could raise a child together i didn't know if i wanted to get married and raise a child with somebody else um and my friend suggested that we raise the child together um even suggested moving to costa rica to raise the child together
11509,444,aw, um and uh so it was a lot of um huge decisions that were gonna determine the rest of my life um and i made the decision based on more common sense and practicality um but i don't regret that decision i think i made a good decision
11510,444,that's good, to marry my husband and raise our child <laughter>
11511,444,yeah,
11512,444,tell me about your kids, um they're older now my uh my eldest is seventeen he is um <tisk> at da vinci science uh school and he's very much into engineering he is getting his pilot's license uh which i'm very proud of him for um then my daughter is fifteen and she loves acting uh she um she has a boyfriend who um uh they see just once a week at church basically um and they text each other constantly um she's a very very typical fifteen year old
11513,444,(laughter, and then i have a twelve year old he is extremely active <laughter> and is in constant motion and is always making noises but i love him dearly um he is into rock climbing and there's a rock climbing gym near our house so he has a membership there so he goes over there and rock climbs almost on a daily basis
11514,444,nice,
11515,444,do you find it easy to be a parent, no i find it extremely difficult i don't i wasn't my mother had a very difficult <d> my dad died when i was young and um my mother kind of disconnected when that happened um so i didn't have a very warm or loving relationship with my mother or growing up and i basically raised myself i was um kind of on my own from a very young age um i mean she was at the house but really had no interaction with her so i really didn't have parenting skills
11516,444,yeah, that you know most people are are raised with um i know what not to do but sometimes it's very difficult and um i i see my friends that have you know these very innate parenting skills these very warm and you know they're making cookies and everything's organic and they knit everything and you know their house is always perfect um and it's like i i'm just not that person so i i i try and be i'm i i think i am a very good mother but i'm not um a typical mother i think i'm more um i'm more creative a lot of times i and we do a lot of things um but it's not a warm fuzzy cozy kind of thing
11517,444,mhm, actually when we go camping it's more i'm more homey when i go camping than i am at home i think i'm more tense when i'm at home but i'm trying to like through meditation and things of that sort i'm trying to become calmer and more patient i think my patience is what um i need to work on the most
11518,444,i understand,
11519,444,how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep, i'm a been an insomniac all my life i remember as a child laying in my bed watching the stars go across the my bedroom window and um i haven't slept well for a long time um but i realize that if i exercise and i do something with my brain intellectually during the day i have to be physically tired and intellectually tired to sleep well um and that's sometimes that's hard to do um and so a lot of times i stay <s> i stay awake reading i'll read 'til midnight um and then i'll try and go to sleep um and usually i won't get back up even if i i'll wake up at three again and things of that sort but i'll try to go back to sleep
11520,444,how have you been feeling lately, yesterday i didn't feel so good i was um i think a lot of it has to depend on the weather  and it was all cloudy and grey yesterday um 'cause i planned on planned on working on my garden
11521,444,yeah, and then i'm i'm building <buil> i'm making a butterfly garden in my front yard um so i had some more planting to do and i just couldn't didn't kind of feel like doing it um so i just sort of puddled about and wasted a lot of time yesterday but  today i feel really good so i feel more positive i feel more energy
11522,444,that's good,
11523,444,have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d, so no
11524,444,have you been diagnosed with depression, no
11525,444,tell me about the last time you felt really happy, um i don't know i just got a new mattress actually that hasn't really helped me sleep but um it was really good because i needed one for a really long time and it i was just kind of excited about being delivered <deli> it delivered and and set up and and that sounds like sort of mundane um but it was you know just like i'm finally doing something positive 'cause it's it's something that i put off doing and put off doing and put off doing and it was like finally uh there and concrete and it's like okay i've done this task that i can check off my list um but also i took the kids camping over um spring break and uh we just had a fabulous time and we sat around telling stories and  um around the camp fire and making s'mores and things like that and those kind of times make me very happy
11526,444,that's great,
11527,444,how would your best friend describe you, <laughter> i don't know um i think she believes that i'm uh uh more intellectual and smarter than i think that i am at times so she comes to me with a lot of um issues uh she always she always solicits advice from me she thinks i give her good advice um and when she doesn't know what to do she'll she'll she'll ask me um and then sometimes she just calls me to run things by uh or just like to complain about because i'm sympathetic
11528,444,uh huh, um or empathetic and uh i just i'm just there to listen and i don't need to give her any advice so i think a a good listener and good advice giver
11529,444,okay,
11530,444,what are some things you wish you could change about yourself, i procrastinate a lot um i start projects and i don't finish them uh so that's what i'm working on right now is finishing up a lot of projects that i've started over the past few months a lot of them are really creative projects and um i'm very enthusiastic about them when i when i start them and i'll get almost finished and then i don't know what happens i just completely lose interest um sometimes i think it's because i'm afraid to finish them which sounds a little strange but um i i'm working on that i'm trying to get those done
11531,444,okay,
11532,444,is there anything you regret, oh gosh <laughter> um not following through on the opportunities i had when i got out of the peace <p> peace corps there was a lot of things that i could go into i could've gone to get my master's degree um with on a grant and things of that sort um but instead i got pregnant and got married and i had a wonderful job that i really liked and really enjoyed um but then when i got pregnant the second time it was right at a time where i had to fight for a directorship and i realized my limitations where i i couldn't be pregnant and have this child and and do everything i needed to do to get a directorship and so i really wish so i resigned um and i wish i had stuck with that um 'cause then i would have a have had a much more fulfilling and rewarding and solid career
11533,444,yeah,
11534,444,what advice would you give to yourself ten or twenty years ago, um not base decisions on emotions sometimes i um and not i i've had some really bad bosses um the jobs were wonderful um but my ego got in the way and i would've told myself to let go of that aspect of the job let go of the the egotistical reactions that i had to the bosses and concentrate on the job and doing that really well
11535,444,mhm,
11536,444,what are you most proud of in your life, um my children actually um and also uh my peace corps experience was just phenomenal um and uh people are actually really interested in that and they were like an awe that they actually know someone who actually did that um so that that's i'm yeah i always when i was a little girl my neighbor was one of the first people to go into the peace corps when it first started and i always said oh i wanna do that one day i wanna do that one day i wanna do that one day and then finally i got to the point where so i'd i either had to shut up or do it um so that's that was one of my prouder experiences
11537,444,that's so good to hear,

11571,445,that sucks, <laughter> i agree
11572,445,tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently, um sometimes when things don't go my way i get depressed or upset and i wish i could calm down and just realize that i should count my blessings and look at the bright side of everything no matter how bad things get always look at the bright side that's my goal

11577,445,wow,
11578,445,that sounds really hard, it was
11579,445,tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory, uh my mother being sick and dependent on oxygen for three years and me seeing her health decline that's what plagues me the most in my dreams and in my thoughts if i could erase that if that never happened i would feel better

11629,446,how did you decide to do that, well um i've always been interested in children um since i was younger um i babysat a lot so i had a lot of um experience with kids at a young age and as i grew older um i realized that it was something that i liked to do um so uh that's when i um looked into child development courses and i thought that it was something um like that i would enjoy <en> enjoy doing so um i started taking classes and um the rest is history
11630,446,are you still working in that, i am yes it's been um fifteen years in august

11633,446,why, well it's something that um i've thought about doing for a while now and um i've actually just began the steps to try to get that going so um i'm gonna be back in school and i'm gonna be taking courses um so that i can make that happen because it is a dream of mine yeah thank you
11634,446,that's great,
11635,446,how hard is that, um it's gonna be pretty difficult um there is uh several years of schooling that i have ahead of me and um you know it's definitely gonna be a challenge but it's something that i'm up for because it is a dream job of mine so it's something that i'm willing to i'm willing to do
11636,446,i understand,
11637,446,do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing, um a little bit of both i think a little bit of both i can be shy at times um and and outgoing as well um but i think a little bit of both i would say
11638,446,okay,
11639,446,sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax, <laughter> uh i meditate i i'm i'm a big big meditator so i love meditating i love just um reading and just having nice quiet peaceful time
11640,446,uh huh,
11641,446,how are you at controlling your temper, oh wow i'm very very good at that very good at controlling my temper i um again um a series of meditation that i do um it involves deep breathing and um just really centering yourself to where you can feel your heart beat and you can um really feel everything in your body and it really really allows you to de-stress and to control anxiety and anger and things of that nature yeah that helps me a lot
11642,446,mhm,
11643,446,that's good,
11644,446,when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about, oh wow it was just recently um actually unfortunately it was last week and it was with my husband and um it was about um just the way he responds sometimes to me uh it can be a little aggressive um and we're just trying to work with that because i don't respond well to aggression i totally tune out and um that's actually what happened so yeah that was it
11645,446,how did you feel in that moment, i felt very frustrated um and i actually felt angered too um but more frustrated and i felt saddened too because i don't like arguing so it was a little bit of all those emotions at one time
11646,446,yeah,
11647,446,tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently, uh <sigh> a situation which i wish i would've handled differently honestly i haven't had a situation like that in in years i've pretty much kind of um you know kind of mastered my responses um to certain um stimuli i've kinda got that down
11648,446,okay,
11649,446,tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make, the hardest decision i've ever had to make well it was when i was sixteen years old and i became a teenage um mother i was pregnant at sixteen and um i had um a lot of pressure from family to um give my child up for adoption or to um abort and i chose life so that was that was one of the hardest decisions if not the hardest decisions to make as a sixteen year old teenage um teenager just whether i wanted to continue to be a kid and a teenager or whether i wanted to embark on raising a life um when i was just a child myself so that i think was the hardest decision i had to make
11650,446,how do you cope with them, um well i mean um my son is almost nineteen now so it's nineteen years later and um i actually um am so glad it was one of the best things that i ever did by not choosing to abort him and choosing <choo> being pro-life pro-choice pro-life and um eh i i have not regretted the decision um that's my only child and i love him he is just a blessing he's just a blessing and i feel very special to be his mom
11651,446,aw, i do yeah
11652,446,do you find it easy to be a parent, um no it's it's not easy uh it definitely um has it's difficulties um just as anything um but at the end of the day it is really rewarding um and you just get to see the life that you brought into the world and that you've raised become a productive citizen and go out into society and just start making their way and it's really rewarding it really is
11653,446,what are some ways that you're different as a parent than your parents, oh wow so many ways um the first way <wa> uh the first way is i actually listen to my son and i um accept his feedback even if i don't like it and i um allow him to express his self fortunately unfortunately when i was little um there was not a lot of um conversation from parent to child um it was more like we were just told you know what to do and we did it um and with my son i give him options i allow him to express his self i allow him to give me feedback um negative or positive because i feel that it's really important for a child to develop their voice at a young age and um as parents you have to be supportive and that and kind of um make sure that you nurture that um because that's kind of um the way that they develop you know and it's really really important so
11654,446,yeah, i'm different in um in a lot of ways in that rite
11655,446,that makes sense, thank you
11656,446,how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep, um <sigh> well it depends um sometimes it it really depends it depends on the time that i go to sleep it depends on the time that i woke up so it's a lot of factors um i can't just give you one answer um i would say that it varies sometimes i can go to sleep um and fall asleep right away and other times i can go to sleep and it might take awhile to actually fall asleep so it varies
11657,446,how have you been feeling lately, i've been feeling great lately i i really have been um i can't um say that like i said the last week didn't affect me um you know the argument with my husband but other than that i i've been feeling really good
11658,446,okay,
11659,446,have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d, no i haven't
11660,446,have you been diagnosed with depression, no i have not
11661,446,tell me about the last time you felt really happy, you know what honestly i feel happy every day you know every day i wake up i'm happy because that is a chance for me to take advantage carpe diem seize the day so um i feel blessed every morning i wake up it's a blessing you know because i realize that some people did not wake up some people are homeless some people are going through so many situations that are really disheartening and that's not me so i feel really really blessed every day
11662,446,that's great, thank you
11663,446,how would your best friend describe you, um as um nurturing patient loving friendly um kind of reserved
11664,446,what are some things you wish you could change about yourself, um well i wish that i had um already completed college and had my master's degree and sometimes i wish i was a little bit more knowledgeable in certain subjects and um i can change if i can change anything i would change that those two things and also i would be um a little bit more outgoing and less of an introvert
11665,446,is there anything you regret, you know what no regrets no regrets um you live and learn um nothing is perfect um everything that i've gone through has made me the person that i am today so i wouldn't change anything because i'm happy with the person that i am today
11666,446,mhm,
11667,446,what advice would you give to yourself ten or twenty years ago, oh <sigh> man to stay in school to stay in school and to get your education and put that first and foremost before a relationship even before your career um i really really uh would would've told myself um to stay focused and to get a great education
11668,446,what are you most proud of in your life, i'm most proud of um where i've come from um as a teenage mother um being a statistic and actually changing that being on my same i've had my uh same job for fifteen years now i'm really proud of that i've been married for thirteen years i'm really proud of that happily married um to my best friend and my soulmate nothing's perfect but um he's my best friend and i love him and i'm also proud of my son um being the mother that i am and the son that i've raised i'm proud of the job that i've done and i'm um i really um applaud myself for that

11677,447,really, mhm
11678,447,what are some things you really like about l_a, uh the fact that you can surf snowboard and like do two drastically different things in one day
11679,447,what are some things you don't really like about l_a, uh coming from the neighborhoods i've lived in uh <tisk> i'd say the population of uh lower socio economic backgrounds it it's like a cesspool almost for young african americans and it sucks
11680,447,yeah,
11681,447,i see what you mean,
11682,447,i'm sure you can tell by my shoes i'm not much of a world explorer do you travel a lot, uh not really i've been to new york connecticut mexico and texas but pretty young
11683,447,wow, hmm <laughter>
11684,447,what do you enjoy about traveling, uh mostly if i'm traveling by plane just the sight and the air is amazing it's remarkable
11685,447,i'd love to hear about one of your trips, uh the first time i went to new york i was about eleven years old and i made sure i got the the window seat on the plane and just the feeling of taking off is just exhilarating but uh we left um <tisk> at night here in l_a and it was the next day in new york so it was kind of confusing getting used to the time change the first thing i remember doing was uh getting a slice of new york pizza
11686,447,(laughter, it was it was delicious <laughter>
11687,447,nice, yep <laughter>
11688,447,what did you study at school, scrubbed_entry graduating with a bachelor's degree in communications so i can go into the military as an officer
11689,447,what made you decide to do that, actually it's like what i don't know it's like you gotta have a plan and that's the only thing that's just fallen into place and it seems like it's going to fall into place for me
11690,447,what's your dream job, hmm to be honest a job that doesn't exist <laughter> it's however you can get paid to do nothing <laughter>
11691,447,(laughter, yeah but uh probably
11692,447,do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing, i was just definitely shy as a kid but i've grown into myself through the experience of college so i'm way more outspoken
11693,447,that's great,
11694,447,sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax, uh i write music and i work out mostly so if i'm feeling stressed out i just do a set of push ups and lift some weights
11695,447,how are you at controlling your temper, i'm pretty good um i saw a therapist when i was a kid for about a year and uh i don't know it it taught me to just be able to control my emotions and i don't think i do it in the best way because when i'm angry i do decide to like just bottle the my emotions in instead of letting them out in their appropriate outlets
11696,447,has that gotten you in trouble, uh not really it's been more of uh an interpersonal thing that's i don't i don't know
11697,447,okay,
11698,447,when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about, probably yesterday something in regards to sports the playoffs are on so things like that of that nature
11699,447,tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently, um <sigh> hm <sigh> so many um i guess in my senior year of high school i waited to the last minute to apply for the u_c schools and it was unsuccessful because i didn't get to turn in the applications and i'm pretty sure i would've been admitted so it sucks but hey
11700,447,tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make, that is an intriguing question <sigh> um i've actually no clue
11701,447,okay,
11702,447,tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory, the death of my grandmother
11703,447,can you tell me about that, sure um my grandmother died when i was eleven years old she raised me from the time i was born because my mother was unable to take care of me she raised my sister my brother and my cousin as well and her five children so she was the matriarch of our family and <sigh> the closest thing i've had to a mother and it was it was tough but um it's gonna be seven years this may next on the thirtieth and uh i've grown quite a bit no more tears
11704,447,that's good,
11705,447,tell me about your relationship with your family, uh i'm a foster kid so i was emancipated from the foster program uh about two years ago now but um my immediate family i'm pretty close with them and i see them as much as i can and uh my foster family they're awesome i've known them since i was five so it's been pretty cool
11706,447,how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep, fairly easy i fall asleep pretty quick it's not a problem except for when my back's hurting you know then it's a problem
11707,447,what are you like when you don't sleep well, mm <tisk> a little moody in the morning i guess i drive more aggressively <laughter>
11708,447,how have you been feeling lately, uh a little stressed about a few problems that i can take care of but i shouldn't stress because i either can do something about it or i can't and that's just the way things work
11709,447,can you tell me about that, uh sure um hm hm uh i have uh a few parking ticket not parking tickets they're not moving violations but they're tickets and i was unaware of if you miss court without being in the hospital or being in jail that you couldn't be excused from not making <ma> making your court date so i had three failure to appears in court which sucked tickets that are thousands of dollars and i have no money so i don't know it's it's pretty tough to deal with when you're trying to make something out of your life but there're so many barriers and obstacles that like you have you didn't forsee so i don't know it gets stressful at times and yeah
11710,447,yeah,
11711,447,how do you cope with them, thinking about it for periods of time some days i just sit and i'm just lost in my thoughts and i don't really communicate to anyone because there's nothing anybody can do for me really so i i just bottle it up like i do everything
11712,447,how hard is that, not very after doing it for so long it becomes a natural thing i i i believe
11713,447,i see,
11714,447,have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d, no
11715,447,have you been diagnosed with depression, no
11716,447,tell me about the last time you felt really happy, hm really happy oh why is that such a difficult question uh mm i don't know i'm pretty content with everything right now i don't know about extreme happiness every day is just the same day seems like
11717,447,okay,
11718,447,tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed, uh dunking across the street at the clippers center there's a basketball court there and uh i've been working on it for a while and i finally got up <laugher> yeah

11721,447,mhm, <laughter> yeah <laughter>
11722,447,what are some things you wish you could change about yourself, mm probably my metabolism which i don't really have control over is uh i don't know i'm pretty content with myself
11723,447,tell me about a time when someone made you feel really badly about yourself, hmm <sigh> i think in uh my sixth grade year of uh uh grade school i was uh i wasn't the best of students but i had a teacher who was diligent and like he failed me through the whole year but i i learned a lot and uh i developed a passion for school afterwards so it was like a situation i overcome after feeling so bad and down
11724,447,okay,
11725,447,who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life, uh the same teacher who made me feel really bad actually because if it wasn't for his like sterness i don't think i would've getting the discipline to be where i am at now in college and stuff so he's been pretty influential
11726,447,what's one of your most memorable experiences, uh i remember this time i was in the desert or uh uh up in joshua tree with my best friend and his dad and we actually got stuck in the mountains and like we went down a gully and then his jeep wouldn't get over a rock so it was it was pretty
11727,447,oh no, yeah it was it was um <tisk> it was kinda weird i i thought i was superman i tried to move a rock that was thousands of pounds didn't work
11728,447,(laughter, but yeah we eventually got out we thought we were gonna be stuck in the desert but it was a fun time i got to drive in the desert when i didn't have my license so it was fun yeah
11729,447,that sounds like a great situation,
11730,447,is there anything you regret, about that day or in general
11731,447,whatever comes to your mind, mm other than like the u_c thing like where i didn't apply to the schools in time i regret that
11732,447,uh huh, yeah
11733,447,what advice would you give to yourself ten or twenty years ago, hm i don't know i was i was ten years old ten years ago <laughter> uh i'd probably say to myself uh <sigh> i i have no clue that's that's an interesting question

11759,448,can you tell me about that, uh i've uh been in and out of trouble with the law when i was much younger i'm i'm passed that point now but uh <sigh> you know when you're young you think you know everything and uh you know you're never gonna get old and the future doesn't matter but uh it does matter because everthing that you do when you're young uh follows you for the rest of your life and i don't regret things that i've done but if i could go back i definitely would make different choices
11760,448,yeah,
11761,448,when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about, uh me and my wife we we <w> we don't argue we <sigh> disagree and it's she's very strong willed and she's a match for me <laughter> so uh we go back and forth but you know we don't get violent and we don't uh uh say meanful things or hurt each other we're just she is a determined strong willed woman and <sniff> i am who i am so we kinda go back and forth and lately i have been the one to <sigh> bow down and be the one to lower the threshold of the argument because uh in the long run it's just her and me and there's nobody else more important to me
11762,448,yeah,
11763,448,tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently, um <sigh> <tisk> when i was younger i wish that uh i didn't follow some of the people that i followed and what i mean by that is you know running in a circle with certain people and having an ego bigger than my common sense and um that's what got me into trouble <sniff> i was an only child and uh i kind of enjoyed being the center of attention and um getting the girls to laugh or having people mm think i was you know cool or whatever you wouldn't think that now i'm kinda overweight and balding but when i was in my twenties i was a a completely different person and <sniff> if i would've had some brothers and sisters i may not have thought or acted that way but i was an only child so i you know ran where people thought i was cool and that got me into trouble
11764,448,uh huh,
11765,448,tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make, hardest decision i ever had to make was giving the authorization to um have my uncle pass away he was on life support and his kidneys had failed <sigh> and um doctors said there was nothing more he could do and to not have him <sigh> go through any suffering to let him slip away and as you can see i get very upset my uncle raised me like his own son and never let me down <sniff> and he's gone and for lack of a better word to push the button i never thought i would have to do that <sniff> but as i said i'm getting over it and um things are getting better slowly
11766,448,okay,
11767,448,who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life, my wife she is uh always there for me <sniff> she will <laughter> always surprise me we she's not my wife she's my best friend <sniff> and she <laughter> knows me better than i know myself um <coughs> we enjoy uh uh doing simple things it's not that we can't do other things if we wanted to but we <sniff> mesh um <sniff> we enjoy each other's company uh we like the same things and uh we you know occasionally go out and do something together but we <clears throat> we just enjoy each other's company and she like i say knows me better than anybody and um it surprises me sometimes
11768,448,that's so good to hear, mhm
11769,448,how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep, you know <sigh> lately well i can't say lately <sniff> if i don't <coughs> excuse me if i don't do a rigorous activity or something that really uh stresses me or strains my body it it let's say for a couple of days i'm just very relaxed and you know not doing much i i just automatically get up after four and a half five hours i mean and you know my wife will say you know guy you're not getting any sleep but i mean i don't feel tired i don't feel exhausted i don't feel like i need to go back to sleep i'll stay up all day and i'm fine and most people would say that's not enough sleep but you know for me i'm it doesn't affect me
11770,448,hmm,
11771,448,how have you been feeling lately, <sniff> well i wish some things could be different but uh i'm not dissatisfied <sniff> um uh i'm happy with my life uh there there uh like with anybody else there's a few things that i wish were different and i think that's in anybody everybody else's uh you know life but um <sniff> i'm i'm i'm i'm i'm content
11772,448,have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately, yeah i feel a little less motivated <sniff> um recently well i can't say recently this was back in january um my wife and a few uh friends were noticing that i was um becoming forgetful and i i couldn't remember things i i didn't see it and um you know when they when everybody brought it to my attention then i started to but anyway i went to the doctor and um they gave me the tests and apparently i have m_c_i which is mild cognitive impairment and uh i've over the last month or so nobody has mentioned it to me i mean maybe i'm getting better but the neurologist that i saw <sss> is having me come back in a year and gonna retest me um hopefully it's not the beginning stages of alzheimer's i'm still a little young for that i'm only fifty <fif> fifty two but um i was diagnosed with uh mild cognitive impairment and uh it it could've been due also i was told by him uh because of the death of my uncle i could've been pretty depressed i was not able to retain things and so well i'm going back in a year and we'll see if uh i'm any better
11773,448,how do you cope with them, i'm sorry
11774,448,how do you cope with them, i'm not understanding you i'm sorry
11775,448,have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d, how <h no no i have not
11776,448,have you been diagnosed with depression, yes
11777,448,how long ago were you diagnosed, two thousand one
11778,448,what got you to seek help, um i was in a um uh what is the word i'm looking for <sniff> i was in a um in a state of mind of of where i was just going to get myself in trouble and and not benefit anything if i didn't seek any help um i was diagnosed with uh depression and anxiety disorder uh worrying and thinking too much about things and uh thinking the worst and uh i i take medication for that
11779,448,do you still go to therapy now, uh well <w> well you know it's not really therapy it's <clears throat> you know every uh few months you know you gotta see the doctor are you doing fine everything good and you know they just refill your prescription <laughter> it's you know it it's you know kinda like the next person next person it it's i i'm with kaiser so it's it's they'll talk to you but it they give you the impression that um you know i i okay let's move along you know they they'll <th> they'll hear your explanation but you know it it they don't have all the time for you that you may want so i i i i'm doing fine now if i really needed help i would i would do something the medication works for me
11780,448,okay,
11781,448,tell me about the last time you felt really happy, <sigh> last time i felt real happy well it would depend on what the event is i'm always happy when i'm doing something with me and my wife and we're enjoying each other and i you know i'm not trying to sound like she's my whole world and i don't have anything else she is my world but um i i i enjoy being with her and we're we we do things together and <sniff> i i i'm happy all the time when when we're doing that um <sniff> when i'm outside of that circle i i i don't know if this sounds right but i'm not seeking happiness i i can only explain it as i'm content i'm not um i i'm not disappointed or i'm not uh wanting anything i'm you know whatever comes my way is fine so
11782,448,that makes sense,
11783,448,how would your best friend describe you, well um <sniff> i don't know i i couldn't give you that answer <laughter> um <sniff> well my best friend is my wife but uh <sniff> she would um describe me as uh i don't think before i speak um i um let the littlest insignificant things bother me and i get angry over but the big things it's like i let it go and she's bewildered by that <coughs> um uh <vocal fry> years and years ago um she i had a uh classic uh pontiac lemans and she had gotten into a minor fender bender and she thought it was gonna be the end of the world 'cause that was my baby and i <sigh> you know hey don't worry we'll get it fixed and she was <w> she thought <laughter> that i was gonna hang her or something you know because that was my this was you know that was my baby
11784,448,(laughter, and uh she goes you know you you get excited over nothing but you know i something like wrecking your car that you love and you've put so many hours of work into it and money you know it gets crashed and it's like you don't care so that's the only way i can explain it
11785,448,mm,
11786,448,what are some things you wish you could change about yourself, well i i need to lose some weight as you can see <laughter> i'm definitely uh been on an eating binge uh and uh the neurologist said that's probably due to the event with my uncle um i'm heavy <heav> i am this is the heaviest i've ever been in my life and i'm finding it a little bit harder um i i can't say harder but i'm i'm finding the will power to say no and to stick with it and to go exercise or you know not you know  movement now going maybe for a walk you know me and my wife when we were a little bit younger we used to love going for walks <clears throat> and we lived in a scrubbed_entry uh boy you know look at that wonder what's inside there you know that that's uh we don't do that no more i guess it's we're a little bit older now and <laughter> a little bit heavier it's harder to walk with all this weight <laughter> but i i i i wish i could change that because uh i i you know it's just not healthy the size <sigh>
11787,448,okay,
11788,448,is there anything you regret, <sigh> uh lately no i don't regret anything lately um <sniff> everything's been fine the like i say the the biggest biggest impact in my life was the event with my uncle and uh i never ever in a hundred years or ever thought that i would face that situation and <sniff> i'll never forget it but they say time heals all wounds and and it does <laughter>
11789,448,what advice would you give to yourself ten or twenty years ago, don't listen to other people uh again i'm not trying to bring up my uncle just because of what has happened but he used to constantly tell me to uh he would see the things that i was doing and the paths that i was going down and i constantly thought i knew better and i think a lot of youngsters think that anyway they um the young lady that i was talking to in here they think they're invincible and so did i <laughter> i figured ah i'm never gonna i'm never gonna have those problems um i wish i could've changed some things um <coughs> the history of my past follows me as it does everybody and that has limited me in in a lot of opportunities and a lot of things that i'm able to do uh i don't miss them but if i could go back uh ten or twenty years i definitely wouldn't make some of the decisions that i made
11790,448,what are you most proud of in your life, my welding certificates um i'm uh certified by the american welding society and i've uh <sniff> uh that's probably the biggest achievement that i've made for you know myself an accomplishment um <clears throat> uh people that i know say that i'm uh well i haven't been working on cars lately but they said that i have a natural knack for uh restoration and working on vehicles and i don't see it but i've been told that once or twice but i i've kind of i i've kind of started to slip away from that i don't i can't say it's from lack of interest but i just don't feel the motivation no more i wish i had a pocket of money and i'd have somebody else to it that's how i feel <laughter>
11791,448,okay i think i have asked everything i need to, okay
11792,448,thanks for sharing your thoughts with me, well thank you
11793,448,goodbye,
11794,449,hi i'm ellie thanks for coming in today i was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment i'm not a therapist but i'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you i'll ask a few questions to get us started and please feel free to tell me anything your answers are totally confidential are you ok with this, okay yes i am
11795,449,okay,
11796,449,so how are you doing today, i'm good thank you
11797,449,that's good, <laughter>
11798,449,where are you from originally, originally from los angeles and my parents are from central america
11799,449,really, yes
11800,449,what are some things you really like about l_a, the weather um i like that i can get to the water if i want to uh to the hills or hike or just any element that i wanna get to i can get to
11801,449,mhm,
11802,449,what are some things you don't really like about l_a, traffic <laughter> busyness everybody's always in a hurry um um that's about it
11803,449,i see what you mean,
11804,449,i'm sure you can tell by my shoes i'm not much of a world explorer do you travel a lot, <laughter> when i can i have family in central america and when i can my husband and i we try to go to warm places like mexico or somewhere on the caribbean
11805,449,nice,
11806,449,what do you enjoy about traveling, the freedom of not having to have my daily routine and not be guilty about not doing something i said i would do if i'm at home and if i'm too far away from home to do it then i don't have anything to worry about <laughter>
11807,449,i'd love to hear about one of your trips, um recently i went to honduras again that's where my family's from so it was sort of like a it's it's a dual fold i get to see my family but i also kinda get to be away from home so i do it by not imposing on them i visit them but i stay in a hotel so that way i can still kinda have my freedom and not feel like i'm obligated to being with them so it's more fun that way
11808,449,that makes sense,
11809,449,what's one of your most memorable experiences, experiences on vacation or
11810,449,yeah, um most memorable experience probably hawaii in lahaina and just having i love food i'm a foodie so having the pig roasted underground and just eating it that way it just i've never been able to taste it that way any time else so it's like a very memory it's a deep memory for me 'cause no matter what i do to my pork it'll never taste like that pork in lahaina <laughter>
11811,449,(laughter,
11812,449,awesome,
11813,449,what did you study at school, business and that was years ago so i ended up in the marketing field so i've enjoyed i my business background did help me in the marketing field
11814,449,what's your dream job, my dream job hmm well i guess it would have to do with food i love to cook and the only reason i hesitate is because i love to cook but i just do it for home and friends and family if it were to turn into in if it were to turn into a job i feel as if it would just not be as joyous or i wouldn't have as much fun as i do have it you know as i have now but if i could just do it as a job and still have the fun and the joy that i have in cooking every day now then that would be my dream job
11815,449,yeah,
11816,449,do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing, i'm outgoing
11817,449,sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax, <laughter> <laughter> that's cool <laughter> uh depends on where i'm at if i'm wherever i'm at actually the first thing i do is just kinda get a hold of myself that way i'm always in control no matter where i'm standing at and always say that i am my own peace p a p e a c e so i just kinda just take a deep breath assess my situation figure out what i can control what i can't control and then proceed from there but just sort of just kinda <deep breath> <sigh> breathe and get a hold of myself first
11818,449,mhm,
11819,449,how are you at controlling your temper, i'm actually very good i'm actually very mild-tempered to begin with um i don't really let anything agitate me and so if i do feel myself just getting hot or if i just react i just sort of just like i said i just do my own little self check you know eh i might've cussed i might've went off for a second but i do my own little self check and just say you know what come on no this is mm it's not worth it this person's not worth it the situation is not worth it be who you are and just stay there
11820,449,when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about, actually it was with my husband and we were going back and forth about my relationship with my father and i was trying to get a point across to him and he was just kinda overlooking my feelings in it and i was i didn't want him to overlook my feelings and act as if i wasn't feeling the way i was feeling so i kept stressing my point in different ways and then i found myself now in a debate and then that's when i pulled back and said no look babe this is how i feel about it i'm not asking you to make me feel any differently i'm just asking you to acknowledge my feelings
11821,449,how did you feel in that moment, when i got to my own conclusion i felt triumphant because the point of the argument in my mind was to clarify how i felt not for him to impose his you know he's very a macho kinda manly guy i didn't want him to just overshadow my feelings with his logic and so i said no as long as i i felt better because i he i felt undestood and i felt heard
11822,449,mm,
11823,449,tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently, hmm <sigh> let's see i can my son comes to mind he's twenty two years old and he we have a very estranged relationship right now and it's okay i'm okay with it he's used to be being a little bit more needy so he i think he assumed that i would just always look xxx go looking for him or call for him as opposed to waiting him to call me and i think it may be a very weird answer but i wish early on in my life as his mother i would've kind of adjusted that so that he wouldn't be so comfortable waiting for me to be the one to come and check on him he doesn't live with me he has his own place but waiting for me to be the one to come and look for him and you know try to make sure that he's okay i think this is probably way more <laughter> ethereal than you meant but i would've i would've done that differently i would've mothered him differently along the way and released him at an earlier age meaning that i would've treated him more of an adult and then also not expected him to just kinda you know i would've killed the expectation in him for me to contour to him if that makes sense
11824,449,uh huh,
11825,449,do you find it easy to be a parent, woo <laughter> no it's not easy you have to sacrifice and beyond just physical things you have to just make sure you put your kid's needs ahead of your own and i guess the second part of that answer is that it is easy once you realize that as long as they're okay you're okay so it my my son my daughter they both know i love them unconditionally so my parenting has become easier the more and more i've lived in that truth where i'm not expecting anything from them but then also not expecting any disrespect so as long as we have that clear line of communication whatever else is going on falls under that category of respect
11826,449,that's good,
11827,449,what's the hardest thing about being a parent, seeing them maybe make decisions that i wish they wouldn't make uh it could be as simple as an outfit <laughter> you know choice or as much as a career change but um having to sit back watch them listen be open and then just kinda just be there you know if they wanna talk about it but then not also also trying not to manage them because i was also their age and i have to remember that i i didn't wanna be managed and even if i made a mistake i didn't wanna be judged so the difficult part is just watching them go through the process on their own and just sort of kinda just waiting around and luckily it's nothing major with my kids but whatever that personal downfall is just kinda being there and not having an i told you i told you so um spirit on me
11828,449,yeah,
11829,449,what's the best thing about being a parent, it's fulfilling knowing that you know i created this you know i planned both my kids so it's just it's a real it's an honor that i was able to do it it's an honor that they're healthy um and it's fun watching them sort of just kind of grow into their own and it's like they're mini me's but then they're also different than i am and so it's fun just being able to allow them uh be who they are and just celebrate them as they are so i'm enjoying that
11830,449,what are some ways that you're different as a parent than your parents, wow completely my parents immigrated here from central america in the sixties um i was born the year after they got here so their their mentality was different they wanted to come and get the american lifestyle eh which was not a bad thing it's just that their parenting style was more about um making sure we had a home making sure uh we had the shelter of course and food and clothes and schooling but there was not really a lot of time spent on the relationship from my mother to daughter to me as a daughter or my father to me as a daughter so i had to kinda figure it out on my own when it came to being a parent
11831,449,tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make, divorcing my first husband um 'cause i was gonna be the one that toppled that whole situation um he was a good father just not a good husband to me and after twenty years i knew that i was gonna be the one to say this is not working for me anymore and since i did that the domino effect has <ha> was is this is not virtual it happened <laughter> we ended up selling our house you know dividing up the assets and then living separately and then my kids were kind of in between for a little while um and then i just made some decisions to where i didn't wanna go through so much court hassle so i just did a tina turner and said just give me my name you keep everything else so it was just a very hard decision by way of how it affected my kids that's all i cared about in terms of losing everything physical and and all the material stuff i could care less but it was hard because i i knew it was gonna affect my kids and they were the only thing i was concerned about
11832,449,what made you decide to do that, uh my husband and i did not you know see eye to eye on certain things xxx regarding our marriage he i didn't feel validated as a woman or as a wife and that's just who i am and those were the very areas that he didn't validate me in he just kinda saw me as a partner who was helping fund his extracurriculars whether it was just travel or or whatever the case may be i'm not i'm not here to talk about that part of it bottom line is that whatever he was doing was outside of you know the sanctity of our home and i was tired of just you know working and and and him benefiting from everything but then not being fulfilled as a woman or a wife and he wasn't prepared to change xxx despite all the counseling we went through and i thought well this is not working for me and i have to take care of myself first and i i had low self-esteem i you know i wasn't perfect i had a lot of things going on with myself and i had to learn how to love myself in order to uh in order for me to love my children and then in order for me to get the love that i should get in return
11833,449,okay, <laughter>
11834,449,how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep, you know what it's actually pretty easy because at the end of the day i just you know good bad ugly or indifferent whatever mistakes i made that day or whatever great thing went on that day my goal in life is just to have peace of mind so when i put my head down at night i i just i ask myself did you know did i do anything that i'm ashamed of today did i cross anybody did i not do you know and i'm not being sanctimonious or acting as if i'm pollyanna but i believe in karma i'm a god-fearing woman so i just wanna make sure that i did everything i was supposed to do today and if there's something that i can rectify you know i just make it a point to promise to myself to go back and rectify it or at least learn from that and just not make that same mistake in another day
11835,449,that's good,
11836,449,how have you been feeling lately, really good light um you know had some rough patches with the family individually like i said with my son my daughter's a teenager so she's kinda coming into her own so that's a different relationship she's opposite of me i'm i'm actually very easygoing very bohemian style she's very social very you know just out there so i'm having to just kinda find our balance but overall it's just i i won't complain i'm very happy for a very simplistic lifestyle that i just kinda foster on my own every day and i just enjoy my little mini accomplishments whether anyone sees them or not
11837,449,okay, <laughter>
11838,449,have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d, no i haven't thank god
11839,449,have you been diagnosed with depression, no
11840,449,tell me about the last time you felt really happy, really happy let's see uh it's at home and i think it was when wow <mumbling> different things running through my head um i think when my daughter and i my teenage daughter and i came to understanding <underst> eh understanding on our mother daughter relationship i'm not trying to be her best friend but yet that doesn't mean she can't talk to me and i think when she came to me the other day and just kinda gave me a big hug from behind me without really saying anything i really felt her just accepting herself and she accepted the fact that i accept who she is as she is so it was a very tame moment only she and i kinda knew about it but it just it gave just a happiness that nothing else could ever give me
11841,449,aw, <laughter>
11842,449,that's so good to hear, thank you
11843,449,how would your best friend describe you, um <laughter> i'm easygoing i'm fun i'm just very you know um eh chameleon comes to mind i just kinda acclimate to what whatever situation i'm in i'm very honest i'm very real and just you know bold if i have to be um i'm just very adult i'm an adult woman and you know they would just decribe <descr> or my best friend would describe me as someone that she can rely on extremely reliable i do as i say i say what i do and i just you know i don't i don't deal with b s <laughter>
11844,449,mhm,
11845,449,what are some things you wish you could change about yourself, hmm what could i change about myself uh probably cosmetic things maybe i would just uh that's not even true let me think what what what are some things i would change about myself um sounds weird that i would say not much <m> nothing really um i think i would just be a little bit more aware of others i think i'm a i'm super sensitive to others but i think i would just be more aware make sure that i'm not being selfish or i'm not tuning anyone out just because i wanna get through my yoga or i wanna do something else i think i would just be more um observant and aware of those around me to make sure i'm not offending anybody
11846,449,uh huh,
11847,449,is there anything you regret, i don't have any regrets i i think about that all the time and you know it's it's natural to go back and say if i were in that situation with the mindset i have now what would i do eh but the reality is that i know that everything that has happened up to this point has shaped me so i can't you know very well take the benefit from it and then turn around and call it a regret because i know i learned from it um probably sounds very textbook but that's true that's just really how i live so i believe that everything good bad ugly or indifferent happened for a reason i truly believe that and my job is to take from it what i'm supposed to take from it and take that into my future so i'm to take the you know the hard knocks with the with the joys
11848,449,i understand,

12233,455,i'd love to hear about one of your trips, um which one to where
12234,455,whatever comes to your mind, uh i guess i'm thinking about egypt and the wonderful experiences that i have there uh as i go the people and the warm and loving experience i have the knowledge i get to pursue through the exploring the temples and the pyramids etcetera things like that
12235,455,what's one of your most memorable experiences, there are so many there really are but i can think of uh seeing a baby in a mosque which was just really pure and it really stayed with me how similar we actually all are um that's probably one of the things that i remember most from one of my very first trips uh there and let's see just the interaction of the people the food you know incredible i love the food too

12248,455,okay,
12249,455,tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently, situation i wish i had handled differently you know i try to take each experience as they come and try not to have regrets to hold guilt about the way anything uh went because they're all for me very positive learning experiences uh that i get to explore who i am through so i don't really see them as needing them to be different i need to learn from them or to um just really accept what is
12250,455,mhm, mhm
12251,455,tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make, hardest decision i've ever had to make um don't really have a quote on quote hard decision you know because i grew up in a way uh where my mother was extremely wonderful in the way that she always taught me to know that it was my own life and so she would never make decisions for me she always taught me to say she would always say it's your life and so um for me decisions don't really come as difficult to make they're pretty easy to make because i've been making them since childhood so i don't really have a most difficult decision i've ever made
12252,455,okay,
12253,455,tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory, mm event that i could erase from my memory i don't really have one that i can think of that would be so terrible that i would need to erase it again everything for me is a learning experience so there's nothing really to regret or erase

12283,456,how does it compare to l_a, um god i love both cities they are polar opposite in many many ways but there's things about both of them that that i love
12284,456,why did you move to l_a, uh to pursue acting and writing
12285,456,how easy was it for you to get used to living in l_a, mm it's still not complete reality to me but it was actually very easy because of the um the the the creative factor out here allowed me to pursue what i wanted to creatively and it was different the social culture was different in a way where i from where i had grown up and it it suited me better my personality
12286,456,mhm,
12287,456,what are some things you really like about l_a, <sigh> oh god <go> i like the fact that you can come here and pursue any any niche of you know <kn> creativity or art or entertainment that you want to and sort of make your own path uh i grew up where it snows constantly and is very very cold so sounds obvious but clearly i like that it's you can swim year round and uh i like that it's there's always something to do no matter what day of the week it is
12288,456,yeah,
12289,456,what are some things you don't really like about l_a, what i don't like uh well i miss my family <fam> i miss that there's not <no> i don't like that there's not a big family element here i miss i'm a big family girl i miss my family i feel like it's very crowded here but yet it's very easy to feel eh sort of isolated alone here
12290,456,i see what you mean, mhm
12291,456,i'm sure you can tell by my shoes i'm not much of a world explorer do you travel a lot, mm i can't see your shoes but um i do mostly just not not too much worldly travel mostly back to boston and mm eh florida where my parents live but i do i enjoy traveling and take a lot of trips within california and around here
12292,456,cool,
12293,456,what do you enjoy about traveling, oh just to have an adventure do something fun or if i'm going home it means i'm gonna see my family
12294,456,i'd love to hear about one of your trips, <clears throat> um one of my trips mm god well i like to drive up to northern california go to san francisco i have family and friends there always super super fun uh in god in college i with my college boyfriend when i was in boston i we drove we went to san francisco and drove down to l_a and las vegas and that was kind of how i realized i wanted to move here so that was very that was very that was a big one
12295,456,awesome,
12296,456,what's one of your most memorable experiences, uh in general just
12297,456,yeah, <clears throat> mm memorable experiences i guess it would be moving here i moved to when i moved to l_a i got on a plane but didn't know anybody here and i just got i talked to a girl that i met online and agreed to be her roommate and she picked me up at the airport we never met and you know one of my dear friends to this day so definitely the the the flight out here was it was big monumental
12298,456,how did you feel in that moment, i felt powerful and excited and just open to whatever
12299,456,that sounds like a great situation, mhm
12300,456,what did you study at school, studied communications um got a lots of every lot of different uh writing writing styles i eventually graduated with a a concentration in public relations and a english minor
12301,456,what made you decide to do that, writing to pursue writing
12302,456,what's your dream job, writer uh well i guess you could say writer slash actress which is um but i guess writing is first
12303,456,how hard is that, hard very hard because you need to no one's gonna push you to do it you have to be self-starter you have to make it happen so it's very hard 'cause i don't possess that naturally in my personality i do but not as much as i need to
12304,456,mm,
12305,456,do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing, i would say outgoing on in general
12306,456,sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax, i <sigh> sometimes take a walk if i feel tense um listen ambient music helps if i need a soothing background white noise calming calming area and just just your basic deep breaths and just sort of take a minute to to come back to a calm neutral place
12307,456,how are you at controlling your temper, i am getting better no <laughter> um i'm okay <ok> i'm good at controlling my temper 'cause i don't usually have a temper too often but when i do and i lose my cool i have a hard time controlling it
12308,456,has that gotten you in trouble, yes
12309,456,can you tell me about that, no <laughter> hmm mm
12310,456,okay,
12311,456,when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about, argued with someone um god i guess it was a friend a friend a girlfriend it it wasn't it was about uh our our each separate perspectives on a a certain situation between us that were obviously very very different um and it started out as something big and then we just realized this is this is stupid we don't need to be fighting about this so it kind of ended quickly
12312,456,okay,
12313,456,tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently, <sigh> hmm mm i guess it would've been with uh an ex-boyfriend fighting with an ex-boyfriend relationship stuff definitely losing my temper and making a situation escalated in a way that it didn't need to be i wish that i had just walked away from it
12314,456,could you have done anything to avoid it, mm i don't know if i could've avoided the complete situation but i definitely could've made the outcome much less chaotic
12315,456,i see what you mean,
12316,456,tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make, hmm uh i guess that would be hmm walking away from somebody who was definitely bad toxic from my life uh but that i really did want in my life and it was a true wrestling with morality and kind of sort of growing up like coming to a point where i have to say i'm gonna have to do something that's really really hard for sort of you know short-term pain for long-term gain and i had to make sort of an adult decision relationship-wise but it was still carried over into other areas of my life and taught me that you know you're not always gonna feel great <gr> every decision's not always gonna be easy and feel good
12317,456,yeah,
12318,456,are you happy you did that, yes
12319,456,how did you decide to do that, i was kinda forced to this issue just what was going on in life was sort of you can't ignore those signs just yeah
12320,456,i understand,
12321,456,tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory, mm i guess it would be a particular argument i had with somebody um that happened to be in sort of a public place and i got in trouble for it i wish i could erase that
12322,456,okay,
12323,456,tell me about your relationship with your family, my relationship with my family <fam> i have a wonderful family i'm completely blessed amazing parents i have a brother and has he has a little girl so i have a baby niece that i love more than anything in the world and i could not ask for a better family they're the ideal
12324,456,that's so good to hear,

12326,456,how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep, it's pretty easy i try um lately it's been a little bit hard my sleep's been off but for the most part i've come to recognize the importance of it and it's it's been pretty easy
12327,456,what are you like when you don't sleep well, <sigh> uh a little edgy or fidgety maybe a little bit out of it i might um might seem like i'm in a good mood 'cause i might be a little giddy and uh laughing more just sort of <laughter> high emotions but overall get um irritated faster and just um sweat more just feel feel um just a little off
12328,456,how have you been feeling lately, i've been feeling pretty good lately

12335,456,aw,
12336,456,how would your best friend describe you, probably as um  very funny humor would definitely probably be one of the first things they would say joking always a little wise-ass in my personality but um they would describe me as always uh unconditional there for them and just they know they know that i'm there if they need them always
12337,456,uh huh,
12338,456,what are some things you wish you could change about yourself, my drive being more driven and just getting things done
12339,456,tell me about a time when someone made you feel really badly about yourself, mm i guess it would be well a recent a recent ex-boyfriend that was a a mistake of a relationship uh yeah sort of just uh i i think because he the way he felt about himself certain things he would say and even though what he said didn't directly make me feel bad the whole situation made me realize wow the fact that i'm even with this person made me feel like i'm let allowing people into my life that shouldn't be there so i'm dumbing myself down and that yeah it was terrible
12340,456,i see,
12341,456,is there anything you regret, yes i regret not listening to my gut instincts
12342,456,what advice would you give to yourself ten or twenty years ago, don't second-guess yourself

12356,457,where are you from originally, uh i'm from middle of nowhere iowa
12357,457,really,
12358,457,when did you move to l_a, <sigh> uh may second of two thousand seven so exactly five years six years ago
12359,457,how often do you go back to your hometown, um infrequently like once every couple years
12360,457,okay,
12361,457,how does it compare to l_a, uh the weather exists so it's more extreme and then  it's rather less exciting a lot less colorful
12362,457,why did you move to l_a, uh winter in minnesota <laughter>
12363,457,(laughter,
12364,457,how easy was it for you to get used to living in l_a, uh it took approximately the drive in that's that's about all it took the lights uh the lights took care of the rest
12365,457,wow,
12366,457,what are some things you really like about l_a, uh i really love that it's a giant concrete playground at nighttime so that bycicles uh have free rein of the streets i like all the art i love the fact that there's so many different kinds of culture jammed all together and that if you look hard enough you can find anything you really want here
12367,457,what are some things you don't really like about l_a, oh you know the traffic <sigh> the exceedingly high cost of living uh yeah those are those are my big beefs
12368,457,i see what you mean,
12369,457,i'm sure you can tell by my shoes i'm not much of a world explorer do you travel a lot, uh not nearly as much as i would like to i've done a little bit
12370,457,what do you enjoy about traveling, uh i like not knowing exactly how things are gonna go i like the fact that it forces me to uh deal with people to deal with situations in ways that i normally wouldn't have to
12371,457,i'd love to hear about one of your trips, uh last year i got to hang out in san marcos for a little bit after i split up with my ex and then after san marcos i went back to iowa for a bunch of family stuff and then i brought my little brother to los angeles
12372,457,aw, <laughter>
12373,457,what's one of your most memorable experiences, uh last week managed to go on a bike ride for cyclavia scrubbed_entry as a <laughter> he was basically a rolling green light the entire way down venice boulevard and so he made he made a bunch of like national news and he was all over the place but the rest of us as his support group riding around on tall bikes and stuff the we didn't bat an eye we didn't blink because this is this is normal for our friends that wasn't even the most absurd thing he's done lately that was just a a happy normal sunday but our group of friends is so unusual that a normal sunday for us is extreme for everyone else
12374,457,(laughter,
12375,457,that sounds like a great situation, <laughter>
12376,457,do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing, i used to be an introvert but definitely an extrovert the last few years thank you los angeles
12377,457,can you tell me about that, um <clears throat> once i found the right group of friends it was easy to be social it it drew me to be social extroverted even outgoing bombastic for the first time and it stuck
12378,457,that's great,
12379,457,sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax, um if i weren't already the most relaxed guy already i would probably do things but when i'm really stressed out i i do all sorts of stuff it um usually i try to enlist my friends to help me do an art project
12380,457,cool,
12381,457,how are you at controlling your temper, uh what temper <laughter>
12382,457,when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about, uh scrubbed_entry
12383,457,how did you feel in that moment, um <laughter> panicked 'cause i really wanted to make him not hate me and i mostly failed
12384,457,that sounds really hard, uh hard on him i mostly uh mostly got by with a couple of scrapes on my ego
12385,457,okay,
12386,457,tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently, uh when  when that all went down i tried to to talk to him but i got distracted for the very first time that day and so instead of having my <sigh> verbal gloves up i managed to take a whole bunch of words to the side of the head and fall over a trash can it was not my most graceful moment
12387,457,uh oh,
12388,457,what's something you feel guilty about, uh i feel guilty about lots of stuff um i feel guilty about eating more often than anything else
12389,457,why, 'cause i really love junk food it's really good i have very little food willpower 'cause i used to be a fat guy
12390,457,(laughter,
12391,457,tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make, i'm not sure what the hardest decision i ever had to make was uh made a lot of hard decisions i guess <sigh> it was pretty hard to leave los angeles after my ex and my best friend did a whole bunch of nasty stuff but it wasn't even that hard 'cause it pushed me to do it so it's a tricky question madam
12392,457,what made you decide to do that, uh oh you know broken collarbone severe pain get surgery on it it all seemed like it made sense at the time
12393,457,i see,
12394,457,tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory, <laughter> mm no my memories are important i have lived a spoiled blessed life and if i changed anything then it wouldn't be the same universe i like this universe
12395,457,i understand, <laughter>
12396,457,tell me about your relationship with your family, uh my little brother lives here he's awesome he's actually right outside waiting for me uh my mom is crazy my dad is crazy everyone else is crazy i'm pretty crazy uh but since most of the rest of them live so far away don't really have to deal with them too much relationship is positive and sparce
12397,457,that's good,
12398,457,who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life, uh jackrabbit's been a pretty positive influence on me lately she is a magical creature
12399,457,can you tell me about that, uh well there's the part where she's intensely physically beautiful there's the part where she manages to hit me with the best inspiration words there's the part where she actually works on the exact things that make me excited there's the part where she pops in and out of my life at the exact right instance and then there's the part where she is a hundred percent kind and caring all the time all of those things are really nice but then when you add to that and compound it with the fact that she does this all without wanting anything in return i don't know that's <sigh> smitten <laughter>
12400,457,how do you know them, uh <laughter> what a funny question how do i know them as though she's multiple people how did you know uh i know her through my bicycle friends <sigh>
12401,457,cool,
12402,457,how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep, uh the hard part is going to bed but as soon as i get to to sleepland i'm pretty much there until an earthquake uh hits so i i get to sleep poorly but then i'm a pro at it so it doesn't matter
12403,457,what are you like when you don't sleep well, <deep breath> less verbose and that's about it my dark circles get slightly larger and i'm pretty much the exact same dude because i've been doing it most of my life
12404,457,okay,
12405,457,how have you been feeling lately, uh so stoked that i might as well be on fire
12406,457,why, um mm because the universe in its infinite uh i suppose the word is sardonic sense of humor uh has managed to convince me of the reality of magic in the arthur c clark sense uh so as a fortunate and <cough> vaguely aware being eh it's my privilege to get to enjoy more time like this
12407,457,have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately, uh yeah uh my excitement is increasing at an almost exponential rate and i'm feeling more and more inspired all the time if i could just work on the motivation i'd be set
12408,457,okay,
12409,457,have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d, mm not since you asked me on the form a little while ago no
12410,457,have you been diagnosed with depression, uh no i used to think i had it but who knows at this point that was awhile ago
12411,457,can you tell me about that, uh i was very unhappy with most of my life for a very long time and then i moved to los angeles and started having fun mm and then that's uh yeah the rest is ancient history
12412,457,tell me about the last time you felt really happy, um twenty thirteen <laughter> uh <sigh> working on my shoes this morning was really nice doodling uh an art project that all my friends helped and put on that's that was really nice it's a nice feeling
12413,457,awesome,
12414,457,how would your best friend describe you, <laughter> <sigh> that's a very good question i'm not actually sure i'll ask him later today though
12415,457,what would you say are some of your best qualities, um i guess i'm enthusiastic i am thesauric and i am <sigh> i'm gonna have to say highly analytical <laughter>
12416,457,what are some things you wish you could change about yourself, uh it'd be nice if i could get my super powers back that'd be pretty cool
12417,457,like what, uh like turning on some of the fancier finely tuned and delicate machinery that chinese medicine has clued me into inside myself <laughter>
12418,457,what are you most proud of in your life, uh that's a really tough one i think the thing that i'm most proud of would probably be <sigh> you know i'm not actually sure <laughter>
12419,457,is there anything you regret, oh all sorts of stuff but i'm working on that
12420,457,what advice would you give to yourself ten or twenty years ago, <clears throat> <deep breath> don't masturbate so much <laughter>

12613,462,that's great,
12614,462,i'm sure you can tell by my shoes i'm not much of a world explorer do you travel a lot, <laughter> yes i've lived in paris and i've been around the world a lot
12615,462,awesome,
12616,462,what do you enjoy about traveling, um uh it's just um it's fun and it's it's it's it's it's it's a blast it's good to see new places it's good to get to um get to experience all the fantastic um sights and and <ss> and cultures
12617,462,i'd love to hear about one of your trips, um uh well i mean um uh i i tended to actually do a lot of them um i probably would do them differently i think i'm more developed as a person now i i um i lived in paris for two years so and i lived in spain for spain was fun spain it madrid is a party town and then um and then so these were all work they were all work so i was working so it was um there's a grind there you didn't really appreciate you know what was around you so much and then i mean i still um i still i love going just to you know vacation spots like hawaii and and jamaica i'm still just really a sucker for that kind of stuff
12618,462,yeah,
12619,462,what's one of your most memorable experiences, um i guess madagascar was pretty much like just really bitching because it was um it was in the eighties and it was like you were seeing a lot of uh people that had never seen white people before according to the guy driving us around i might he might've been lying um but it was just it was bitching africa was pretty much the best senegal and madagascar yeah
12620,462,nice,
12621,462,what did you study at school, um i'm right now about to go for an early childhood education degree and then i did a little bit of paralegal but that was really just to just to get the um just to get the stipend i didn't really have any concept of what i wanna do now i really do
12622,462,what made you decide to do that, i have i was saying to rachel actually i don't know if you guys were able to overhear i really think that um the way the school system goes right now it um it just it it turns people into into um just um just uh dog eat dog um you know i i don't like the way the people <peo> it i think it's so draining the um school system right now and i feel pretty bad for everybody so i wanna try to fix that
12623,462,yeah,
12624,462,what's your dream job, that would be my dream job that so i'm excited that like i wanna go in a direction that i wanna go in and yeah that would be my dream job is to work with sort of getting um kids on a more um organic universal um you know uh trajectory
12625,462,how hard is that, um i think it could be done i don't think it would be done via any sort of um legislation except here and there i mean it it that always ends up for becoming you know facade and farce itself anyway but i think there are ways i've always reached kids anyway and they've always felt where i was coming from and so i think you know there are ways to sort of buck the system without even talking to the system
12626,462,okay,
12627,462,do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing, uh i guess i'm just a combination of the two i don't think um i don't know actually i'm kinda i might even be working that out there might some outgoingness to overcompensate for what's actually shyness and vice versa so you don't know
12628,462,(laughter, <laughter> yeah
12629,462,that makes sense, yeah
12630,462,sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax, yeah that's cool um i definitely um uh try to reflect and stay in a pretty lucid space as often as possible so a lot of lying down at the moment i'm in transition so there's just a lot of and i and i hang out with my dogs a lot so that's quite soothing i try not to do i don't really do anything that's too tense unless it's time for it like time to drive to a job or time to you know go make some things happen meetings and stuff but otherwise um i try to stay in a pretty relaxed space most of the time so it's not like break and but you know and i i miss <mi> i miss swimming i can't believe summer's coming so i'm gonna swim some more too
12631,462,mhm,
12632,462,how are you at controlling your temper, um when i'm truly outraged uh it comes out and then i i'm i'm i'm hitting some kind of bad parts right now 'cause it's a very hard time i'm fighting for my child so there are times when i will just cuss up a storm just to get off some steam
12633,462,has that gotten you in trouble, a little bit but usually pretty much there's always um you know someone in the periphery that gets it and and you know it's like that bumper sticker if you're not outraged you're not paying attention so usually some kind of sanity can prevail
12634,462,when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about, oh well i mean these are times where i just can't find somthing in the car and but when i argue with people it's been a lot of the times when i'm being flat out you know um sabotaged or or definitely just when uh what's the last specific time well i you know i lost my temper dreadfully with um unfortunately um the woman that gave me birth because that she is intrinsic in a lot of i mean she's pretty much a horrible person so i i recently lost my temper with her
12635,462,how did you feel in that moment, i felt like um i mean i like again um i think i sort of said this just now i felt in a way good because i get it you know which is as opposed to not getting it which is even worse but i guess there's another side of the bank of the thing to get to to where you can be a little more constructive about it it's like you know you get to a point where you're glad you can actually see that there's a horrible travesty going on but then you have to figure out how to deal with the horrible travesty but so i mean i don't <do> i didn't feel like shame i really honestly didn't feel shame i didn't i didn't feel
12636,462,i understand, there are times when i feel like it was stupid to lose my temper just because there are people that will try to use that against you that's all but i never really feel bad for
12637,462,yeah, being angry about what i'm angry about
12638,462,okay,
12639,462,tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently, well when i was pregnant i wish i had um like i said um i i went through um such an awakening about realizing when i was being sort of um undermined that um that demanding my respect became a huge issue and when i was pregnant i ended up being so disrespected in the place 'cause i was being a hippie on the beach for six years so i always felt like i was being so disrespected in the place where um i was set to be when the child arrived that i stormed out via what was a good survival mode before but left me jumping out of the frying pan into the fire and they got my kid so
12640,462,wow, yeah
12641,462,that sounds really hard, it's fucked up yeah
12642,462,tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory, i don't want to erase anything from my memory i like having everything consolidated and cohesive i don't and integrated i don't wanna erase anything from my memory
12643,462,okay,
12644,462,tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make, um well did i get it right or did i get it wrong <laughter> um yeah i'm uh i guess the hardest decision was whether or not to sign um sign mediation agreement with d_c_f_s and i should've said no let's just go straight to court because the there is nothing wrong with me i just happen to succumb to an s_s_i check via bullshit with my mother and i should've just been you know um brave enough to just go in there and do that and instead i chickened out and did their mediation and they played me out
12645,462,what made you decide to do that, overcautiousness
12646,462,okay,
12647,462,tell me about your relationship with your family, it's horrific horrendous bourgeoise quality intrigue and sabotage it's bad
12648,462,i'm sorry, it's okay
12649,462,who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life, someone that i mean there's been um you know there's been some some great people uh again from afar i have not sort of really um achieved a real great ability to build relationships and i'm working through that right right right <r> right now and i think that's a lot why i don't have my son but as i've grown and developed i've seen encouragement from like minded souls and you can see that and so that's wonderful and um but otherwise you know a constant you know contact with someone that's really good for me it has been hard for me to um get to that point
12650,462,okay,
12651,462,how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep, not so easy these days at all
12652,462,why, um i'm being i've been um i'm not completely centered and then there's been some um actual you know uh people thinking it's funny to harass me or jolt me as they walk by and so there's been actual harassment and stuff like that
12653,462,what are you like when you don't sleep well, um i'm still pretty pollyanna'd out i still forge ahead and try to be as pleasant as possible
12654,462,how have you been feeling lately, i'm tired and drained and a little bit um frustrated because that i know that um i've been sort of that i sort of have a bit of um my um energy and and space being usurped <u> usurped and i can tell and i don't know how to get through that and past it
12655,462,have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d, no

12762,464,yeah,
12763,464,i'm sure you can tell by my shoes i'm not much of a world explorer do you travel a lot, um yeah i've been to mexico <me> uh mexico and the temples and northern california so yes
12764,464,nice,
12765,464,what do you enjoy about traveling, traveling like cleaner air that's good it's healthier for your body cleaner bloodflow the um people culture and stories and when you come back you share stories with like your friends
12766,464,that makes sense,
12767,464,i'd love to hear about one of your trips, yeah um any time like right now or when
12768,464,uh huh, okay so like this one time when i was kid we went out to the temples and um it started raining so we just start walking through and like when we get to the top one thing i didn't know before is that the higher you go the the smaller the steps get so like people back then had uh smaller feet so what happened was as i went higher towards the temple i had to walk sideways so my feet could measure up to the the the steps but once you get up there it's a nice view i yeah
12769,464,awesome,
12770,464,what did you study at school, uh general education but um mainly art yeah i took a lot of a lot of art classes
12771,464,what made you decide to do that, um well when i was a kid i scribbled on walls with crayola so i figured you know like it kinda stuck around with me so i just pursued it so yeah
12772,464,what's your dream job, my dream job would be to get paid for painting painting art
12773,464,(laughter, yeah um yeah pretty simple
12774,464,how hard is that, um it's not so much that it's hard it just requires passion um persistence and faith and will you just have to really believe in yourself the more you believe in yourself the more likely you are able to succeed
12775,464,mm, mhm
12776,464,do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing, i consider myself to be shy in certain um time and places but i am also out outgoing when like i have the energy so i feel like it's well balanced you know like i'm shy when it's i guess okay to be shy you know and i'm outgoing when like the need to actually um have fun or just explore it feels good like if that makes sense but yeah
12777,464,i understand,
12778,464,sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax, <laughter> yeah to uh relax um either well i don't know if i should say this but i smoke weed <laughter> so that helps and i like painting painting pretty much helps me relax you know especially when i use the color blue because the color blue um relaxes me and also green when i use these two colors and make a painting it calms <calm>calms me down
12779,464,cool, yeah and you have a blue shirt yeah
12780,464,how are you at controlling your temper, my temper um well my thoughts my thoughts control my emotions and my emotions yeah that's pretty much how my temper i i try to make sense you know like is it worth getting mad or if i do get mad what will be the outcome you know so controlling my temper is just by training my thought
12781,464,mm,
12782,464,when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about, um <sigh> the last time i argued with somebody was with my with my father and it was because i wanted to eat food but he wanted me to buy wine so right when the food was ready i was hungry to eat and he was like no so that kinda frustrated me and the way i handled it was like well i could just eat when i come back and i'm doing him a favor so you know and then after you know i could just eat in eat in peace so
12783,464,yeah, yeah
12784,464,tell me about your relationship with your family, my family um it's pretty good um my mom my dad have a good relationship still <s>still married and my brothers and sisters um we help one another out so that's good it's just yeah it's like a team
12785,464,that's good,
12786,464,tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently, a situation i wish i could handle differently would be hmm that's a good question i mean can i get a scenerio
12787,464,whatever comes to your mind, okay um a situation i could handle differently well see that's the thing like i feel like if i'm calm in any situation i could figure it out you know but if it came down to like a rubik's cube maybe how would i handle the situation would be just by uh failing um failing making mistakes because i would make the right mistakes and the right lessons would come after so that's the best way i could answer your question you know
12788,464,okay, yeah
12789,464,who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life, a positive influence pretty much anybody who told me the truth has been a positive influence  influence  you know like yeah even though it may hurt like oh the truth does hurt well they're not trying to be mean they're actually good influences so i would say my friends uh my mom my dad my brother my sisters yeah
12790,464,mm,
12791,464,tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory, mm well see that's the thing like you like i have i've had some pretty bad experiences with like being at gunpoint and with a knife but at the end of the day what that did was like give me more insight it made me more aware and it taught me how to read people a little bit more like just sense things out and also how to avoid situations so even though it was bad and it did kinda like scar me it did prepare me for like the world you know because this happened to me when i was like twelve thirteen years old so i was already being exposed to like you know like guns knives and all that stuff so
12792,464,wow, it's it's bad but it's good in the long term you know because if you get out of that slump it's like nothing else would really phase you because oh you think you know in your head like oh i've been through worse so it's not as bad you know and
12793,464,yeah, so yeah
12794,464,tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make, the hardest um man this one right now uh see for a the moment i got stuck i was like trying to think that was that was part of it
12795,464,(laughter, but uh hardest decision as far as like life changing
12796,464,yeah, life changing whether to continue school college or not mm i kinda chose to like i went to school but i chose to pursue my own like like i'm learning more by connecting myself with people who are already in the field i wanna be in so that was a hard choice because there was no um guarantee that i would like run into like the right people but i took that chance and you know i met the right people so yeah
12797,464,are you happy you did that, yeah yeah
12798,464,that's good,
12799,464,how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep, um it's actually really easy i sometimes yeah like if i wanted to i could sleep right now in like ten minutes you know i could just like shut down my mind like yeah just calm down
12800,464,wow, like like slow down my air pattern
12801,464,(laughter, yeah mhm
12802,464,how have you been feeling lately, lately i've been feeling good i've been feeling like i have free will like at this point in time i feel like if i chose a path any path with like my heart i could get there you know but i'm kind of like still deciding it's like everything in all all these paths are in the air just trying to make my own i don't know that's where i'm at i feel like i have free will so yeah
12803,464,that's great,
12804,464,have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately, lately like in the past two weeks or today
12805,464,whatever comes to your mind, <laughter> okay uh yeah you know like um yeah things happen that would change like my feelings and for example right now it just happened
12806,464,like what, huh for right now like
12807,464,like what, this experience for one is kind of like a shift in my thought because yeah it's like it's technology you know it's like it's a trip to see how far like one could take a thought and then make it reality so that's kinda like shifting my thoughts right now this experience this this whole experience yeah
12808,464,okay,
12809,464,have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d, uh post traumatic stress disorder no
12810,464,have you been diagnosed with depression, depression i know how it's like to be depressed but diagnosed by a doctor no
12811,464,can you tell me about that, uh depression how how it feels
12812,464,mhm, how does depression feel like it feels like it's like a bird in a cage being depression is like being <ss> a fish who can't swim in the water i have feeling depression is like being a bird without wings um pretty much it feels like you're limited but then the thing is to get out of that depression it's like you have to awaken and change your perspective and focus on like i i would say colors colors help and people talking to people helps yeah
12813,464,when was the last time that happened, um being depressed mm let's see mm i don't know like it could <cou> it could come like it could happen everyday in like in small doses doses so like i i could say today you know earlier when i was just by myself i felt a little depressed but then what happened i fixed it like called up a friend and met up with him and yeah
12814,464,that's good,
12815,464,tell me about the last time you felt really happy, um i mean at this moment i feel pretty happy you know i'm talking to a virtual person it's pretty cool and yeah right now i feel happy
12816,464,awesome, <laughter>
12817,464,how would your best friend describe you, um sometimes hard headed like he would try to teach me um a certain lesson whether it's art or just like in my character and yeah he would probably just describe me as like like like he would listen but at the same time he'll still do what he wants to do so pretty much like i don't know yeah i mean that's what he tells me but yeah overall good person
12818,464,mm,
12819,464,what are some things you wish you could change about yourself, um probably just exercise um my diet food my food intake and yeah just exercise pretty much it
12820,464,tell me about a time when someone made you feel really badly about yourself, my health mm i would say when i was like in middle school or in elementary a little bit of high school too but what it would
12821,464,can you tell me about that, yeah what it would be was it would either be about um well pretty much my art <laughter> like if i ever did something and i thought it was good then someone else would be like oh you know that looks kinda like like trash and then i'd be like oh damn either i could accept it and be like yeah it does kinda look and then fix it or what i would do back then would be like damn you know just kinda dwell on that thought and then just like stay there for a bit and then eventually i'll come out of it but yeah usually it's um people's words and ideas that
12822,464,i understand, yeah yeah so that's it
12823,464,is there anything you regret, regret um yeah i got a couple things i regret
12824,464,like what, like what well sometimes i feel like i should've completed a whole university thing but i mean at the same time i feel like if i really wanted to go i would have gone so yeah that's kind of a regret in my head
12825,464,yeah,
12826,464,what advice would you give to yourself ten or twenty years ago, ten or twenty years ago would be um seek spiritual well being you know learn how to um handle your thoughts choose your thoughts i would teach myself um pick the right <r> people you surround yourself with because that   definitely has a major influence in your environment uh certain events you would experience and as far as your overall happiness yeah

12944,466,i'm sorry, <laughter>
12945,466,how hard is that, uh incredibly difficult
12946,466,can you tell me about that, um yeah i'm i'm guessing you mean the agoraphobia um more so than the fear of flying um
12947,466,mhm, it's uh it's more of a recent um development and um it's um eh it's progressing <pregr> progressing um to be worse uh it's very um uh what's the word um immobilizing and and very um distressing actually
12948,466,that sounds really hard, mhm <laughter> yes it is
12949,466,how do you cope with them, how to i cope with that um just uh just trying to um uh do the best i can and uh try to you know have the most courage i can in the situation and challenge myself in um small steps um i read a lot i do um bibliotherapy reading um and i try to inform myself um of the um of the professional literature um so that i could um hopefully overcome it someday
12950,466,that's good, mhm
12951,466,are they triggered by something, um yes definitely
12952,466,like what, um uh certain things trigger it like um enclosed spaces um being in a car traveling um uh being away from home um being in someone else's car uh things that are outside of my uh locus of control

12957,466,what made you decide to do that, um i'm not a psychologist but what would make me decide to do that is um uh having lived um through some challenges like this um having lived through some traumas um but i've always had an interest in it um since junior high of um uh i'm very interested in people and um in human interaction and human connection and um the betterment of of uh of those things um bridging people together and helping people interpersonally through their challenges <chall> uh personal uh challenges um uh so that's that's sort of um it in a nutshell

12974,466,yeah,
12975,466,tell me about your relationship with your family, well that that was my family that was um the the good side of my family there's um uh uh the majority of my family <fa> they were they were the the loving aspect of my family um the rest of my family is very cruel and um like very abusive

13010,466,what are some things you wish you could change about yourself, um i wish i could change about myself um my anxiety um i wish i could change about myself um my agoraphobia my p_t_s_d um meaning my trauma um and um uh what else um um my insecurity uh as far as um uh just um with <w> with other people in the sense that i'm always trying to make sure that um that i don't do something that that um hold on one second i'm just trying to make sure that um i don't do anything that's um offensive to them or insults them um or uh is disrespectful um and i i feel like i'm overly um cautious about that and um it it it kinda becomes um an anxiety unto itself um so i i definitely think that that would be beneficial uh to change um the other thing i'd like to change about myself is i wish i could feel um and also depression i'd like to change that about myself i wish i could feel better um i wish i didn't feel um uh so um uh i didn't wish i didn't have the burden that i do of um my family um of not having one um and uh what else um i wish i didn't have my illness and the physical um excruciating pain that i'm in uh so those are some things um
13011,466,mhm, and i also wish that um and this is um a a by-product of p_t_s_d i wish that i didn't have um uh the the symptomology of p_t_s_d um 'cause that definitely um affects one's complete <com> complete the complete life like eh a lot their affects their life uh completely um and i i wish i was more articulate and i wish i was um someone who was well-spoken and someone who is well-written um but there's many there's many more um uh things that i wish i could change about myself to improve myself so many more
13012,466,yeah,
13013,466,what advice would you give to yourself ten or twenty years ago, <sigh> um i'm not sure uh <sniffle> maybe to um not be so trusting um i trusted um i trusted some medical professionals that um you know again created the injury and um you know were there's a uh what's the word there's an expectation and a sort of a demand to just blindly trust um the medical profession um and <sniffle> um don't ask questions and just sort of um you know and if and not to trust your own self your own um your own instincts um or intuition um and so i would i would've told myself to be a little more careful um i guess if that's useful to your question
13014,466,mhm, <sniffle>
13015,466,tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed, um what did i really enjoy um you know i can't think of anything specific um but um i know it would have to do um with either reading or um connecting with someone on a meaningful level
13016,466,okay, <sniffle>
13017,466,what are you most proud of in your life, i'm most proud of um my compassion um my um my uh empathy and caring about people um despite um i mean i'm proud of it anyways but um also particularly <sniffle> um i come from a um an environment that's the opposite um a background and um i wasn't taught that <sniffle> um but i really do care about people and um i'm i guess i'm most proud of that i'm also proud of my um career accomplishments um and my um tenacity um my fierce <fie> my fierce tenacity to succeed um <sniffle> and uh you know just um also to get um the strength it takes to get through um the injury uh to live with it and to live with the illness um that i live with the physical illness um so i i think that would be it <sniffle>

13126,468,what made you decide to do that, um i've always wanted to own my own business and i figured management be a a good uh foundation to build on and uh learn more about so i decided to go into management just to see the various aspects of what it takes to really manage your own business and um and then economics is just to just for long term investments i really wanted to start earning some stocks and e_t_fs and mutual funds and start buidling my portfolio up so i figured economics would be a great way for a long term investment financially so that's why i did my economics
13127,468,are you happy you did that, yeah i'm really stoked it was one of the best decisions probably of my my life
13128,468,that's great, yeah
13129,468,do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing, i consider myself more outgoing i'm i'm pretty friendly i don't mind to open up to people and stuff
13130,468,why,
13131,468,sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax, <sigh> i like to be outside like to go hiking i like to go um working out at the gym but i mostly like to be outdoors i i love nature and just to be outside just just puts me at ease
13132,468,okay,
13133,468,how are you at controlling your temper, from pretty good for the most part i'm pretty mellow chill guy and when i do get angry here and there i uh it just lasts for like a couple minutes and before i know it i just it just blows over i don't tend to hold on to things or stay angry and hold grudges just 'cause there's no need to life's too short for all that
13134,468,when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about, um see i can't even remember the last time i argued with anybody i have no idea
13135,468,(laughter,
13136,468,okay,
13137,468,tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently, probably when my uh my brother and my girlfriend got in a little little argument uh like two birthdays ago and it's been awkward kinda ever since um i wish i would've just handled it right then and there rather than it letting it just stretch out as long as it has been it's just awkward for both parties i wish i just would've communicated with both of them and told 'em to you know set their differences aside and let's just communicate and try to see we come up with a solution but now it's just awkward
13138,468,that sucks, yeah it does
13139,468,tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make, the hardest decision i've ever had to make man that's a toughy i don't think i've had too many tough decisions to really say the hardest decision i've ever had to make um maybe not moving to colorado for my undergrad two three years ago was a little tough just 'cause i kinda think what if but other than that nothing has really been too tough in my life that was really that hard of a decision
13140,468,okay,
13141,468,what's something you feel guilty about, i don't really feel guilty about anything pretty good person i think and for the most part i couldn't think of anything
13142,468,tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory, something i could wish i could erase from my memory um nothing really to be honest i i love all my memories they're usually positive for the most part i know that's kinda weird for somebody to say but i've lived a pretty good life and i'm happy
13143,468,that's great, yeah
13144,468,tell me about your relationship with your family, uh it's cool um i'm pretty independent for the most part so when i do see 'em here and there it's it we go through long periods of times with no contact maybe a couple weeks sometimes even a month but uh when i see 'em it's it's good you know i like to say hi and show 'em i love 'em still and it's not that i don't mean to like not contact 'em they could always contact me but uh it's good for the most part i guess as a young adult mm
13145,468,mhm,
13146,468,who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life, my girlfriend's family uh they've been very positive in my life uh if it wasn't for them i think i'd be in a different direction just 'cause in high school i didn't really care about higher education i didn't care about really thinking long term and uh just seeing them <th> them and what their family does and how they think differently like with your higher education and how to get somewhere in life and the if you do these things this is what it could lead to and they've been very successful they own their own uh accounting practice and seeing that influenced me to achieve higher in life
13147,468,that's so good to hear, yeah

13154,468,have you been diagnosed with depression, i've never been diagnosed with depression <sigh>
13155,468,tell me about the last time you felt really happy, the last time i felt really happy was probably seeing my girlfriend graduate a couple days ago she had uh just graduated from nursing school on monday
13156,468,aw, and uh to see her walk across stage and stuff just 'cause we've been together for six years and seeing her go through the nursing program for five and it's just seeing all the ups and downs it's really good to see somebody just strive through and achieve what they want to achieve and just made me really proud of her
13157,468,that's great, yeah
13158,468,how would your best friend describe you, probably outgoing friendly positive vibes all around adventurous loves sports team player knows how to be a leader here and there

13160,468,has that gotten you in trouble, no not really for the most part no not really
13161,468,okay,
13162,468,what are some things you wish you could change about yourself, just be a little more motivated i used to be so motivated and right now i'm just maybe 'cause i'm just done with school and i'm over it that i just don't feel as motivated but i just i wanna be more motivated and determined right now and that's not i'm not going that way right now so
13163,468,i understand, mhm
13164,468,tell me about a time when someone made you feel really badly about yourself, no biggie <sigh> oh man i couldn't can't really think of a time
13165,468,okay,
13166,468,tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed, i went caving two weeks ago that was a lot of fun uh we went up to sequoia national park and uh i went caving with a for an r_t_m class it's like this uh recreational tourism management class and caving was an elective and our professor was like a world renowned cave specialist and he took us to these various caves in uh sequoia and just me and these strangers or my classmates and becoming really good friends at the end was a lot of fun and rappelling down into caves climbing back up going through different rooms and chutes it was a lot of fun that was
13167,468,that's great, yeah
13168,468,what advice would you give to yourself ten or twenty years ago, ten or twenty years ago i'd probably say just stay more focused on school a little less on the social aspects and uh kinda stick with one sport just to see how far that could get ya
13169,468,is there anything you regret, um <sigh> sometimes not playing hockey through uh through middle school and hockey sometimes <someti> i mean through middle school and high school sometimes and um and that's pretty much it now

13372,471,tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently, hmm a situation which i wished i could handle differently um i eh in my later years i would say eh i don't have many regrets in my younger years i used to uh be snubbed by people and i would keep my mouth shut and i wouldn't say anything i would not express my displeasure of their actions or their behavior i would just keep my mouth closed and internalize my feelings i've learned that that is so wrong and so in the probably the last fifteen to twenty years i have made it a point to vocalize my displeasure with someone's actions right away and that uh takes care of the anger immediately
13373,471,has that gotten you in trouble, yes it <i> it depends what you mean by trouble uh i think eh all the way around once you take the beginning <benning> the beginning to the end uh it diffuses trouble rather than prolongs or protracts the trouble
13374,471,that makes sense,
13375,471,tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make, uh going back it would be to not to pursue uh medicine like my father wanted we argued uh at length for many months and years about this and uh finally i prevailed and uh i didn't go to i didn't go that route uh but that was probably the most uh uh difficult period in my life
13376,471,i see,
13377,471,tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory, mm there was a time when i wished i could erase a female interactions uh girlfriends and and their uh betrayals uh but now i realize that keeping those memories make me who i am today and and dealing with them defines who i am today
13378,471,mm,
13379,471,tell me about your relationship with your family, uh my parents are deceased i had very good relationships with my parents uh i'm very thankful for that um even though my father was somewhat of a uh hard-handed uh and draconian <laughter> person uh we came to an understanding well before he died and uh my brothers i get along great with my younger brother but my older brother has issues he has uh psychological issues and they <th> they continue to plague him and to affect me also just just knowing that he's going through uh turmoil
13380,471,i'm sorry,
13381,471,how do you cope with them, uh well i guess i really don't cope with it because um he's clinically depressed and he has suicidal tendencies and uh he's not working he's very highly educated and he uh well he doesn't talk to me and uh his family is very abusive towards him it's an not a happy relationship for his family
13382,471,that sounds really hard, yes
13383,471,who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life, you know i would have to say my father my father is my hero he's my uh model he's my uh archetype for what a man should be uh he's he was unimpeachably honest and kind uh yet on the other hand he was uh he had high expectations of me and my two brothers
13384,471,i understand,
13385,471,how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep, eh usually once my head hits the pillow i am dead asleep like a log but lately i've been having uh just last night i couldn't sleep i woke up at two and i have a feeling it's because of a diagnosis of cancer that i received one month ago
13386,471,how have you been feeling lately, um xxx i with my own personal uh methods of handling stress i i'm okay i'm probably ninety percent okay that ten percent comes from uh eh an unsuredness about the future about whether i will survive this or not
13387,471,have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately, not really
13388,471,do you feel down, no
13389,471,have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d, never
13390,471,have you been diagnosed with depression, never
13391,471,tell me about the last time you felt really happy, oh i was either surfing or snowboarding or rock climbing or mountain biking uh i always experience joy when i'm exercising at a very high level of exertion
13392,471,that's so good to hear,
13393,471,how would your best friend describe you, funny jovial uh uh intelligent a perfectionist
13394,471,what are some things you wish you could change about yourself, hmm eh that's no one's asked me much about that um maybe uh is to submerge my uh hedonistic self
13395,471,can you tell me about that, i look at once again my father fills my consciousness he was the ultimate um uh deferrer of gratification he put now behind him and he put what will be in the future in his sights and he never let go of that and that's what made him the uh self-made man that he was whereas i am looking always for the present um how i feel now and it's difficult for me to uh slog through a a mile full of uh crap in order to get to a prize that is so far away
13396,471,yeah,
13397,471,tell me about a time when someone made you feel really badly about yourself, <deep breath> it would be my ex-boss and he started using at my last day of work when he fired me he started using uh a lot of profanity toward me and eh i turned to him and i said you cannot talk to me that way and he continued to use more profanity until uh i objected to it again and that's when he fired me and uh that that's still in my mind and that occurred a year and a half ago
13398,471,wow, mhm
13399,471,is there anything you regret, anything i regret uh yeah i regret not getting married and having kids
13400,471,could you have done anything to avoid it, sure i suppose i could uh eh but i think that that would've robbed me of the many opportunities i had and i took to travel around the world and experience different cultures because that's what i enjoy the most about life is exploring and seeing different things and talking to different people and expanding my awareness because the united states is not the end of the world it is <i> eh once you get to travel you find out that we are not we do not have the highest uh level of uh of living in the whole world other people think that we're the only ones that think that and i disagree
13401,471,right,
13402,471,i see what you mean,
13403,471,what advice would you give to yourself ten or twenty years ago, mm that's a good one i would say <laughter> i would say to just enjoy life because you never know when it's going to end and i think i've done that and uh i may be coming to an end soon uh with this diagnosis of cancer so i think i've done i'm i'm happy with my life thus far
13404,471,tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed, i was giving a rock climbing lesson i have a uh part time job of instructing rock climbing and many of these people have never done it before and uh they thanked me and they told me what a great time they had and how this may have changed their lives so that was very gratifying to me
13405,471,that's great,
13406,471,what are you most proud of in your life, <deep breath> i would say <sigh> my devotion to the environment uh i wasn't always an environmentalist but uh i have been uh vocal in the cause of uh uh being a um uh a steward of the environment because today they're a lot of peoples people that are polluting the environment with a lot of chemicals and pollutants and septic uh things like that and i stand up and i uh have been on t_v and on uh youtube speaking up against these people that pollute the environment

13814,477,how hard is that, um i'd say it it it's fairly hard um in the sense that um you know it can be challenging for people to actually be motivated and do all of the work that needs to be um undertaken in order to realize their their dreams but and it it's also a challenge because making a living at it uh requires charging people money <laughter> so um finding people who are willing to pay for that can be um difficult too
13815,477,yeah,
13816,477,do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing, um i'm definitely on the shyer side i'm an introvert so
13817,477,why, um i'm pretty good in one on one situations with people but when you get me in a group with more than a a couple of people i'm very much an observer so i tend to listen a lot and i'm not as engaged and i think that um is something that goes it is noticed by others and it it maybe is a little bit odd to them especially if they're not introverted um so i i'd say and it's also a challenge for me i tend not to be the person who introduces myself um in a room full of strangers
13818,477,okay,
13819,477,how are you at controlling your temper, <laughter> pretty good i think um but i do have a temper so i can get i can get upset from time to time
13820,477,has that gotten you in trouble, not really um it can be a challenge when i'm driving <laughter> but other than that no
13821,477,when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about, hmm hmm i'm not sure it would've probably been a discussion over politics and it probably would've been a friendly argument um probably with one of my liberal friends so but i actually can't remember the specific time
13822,477,mm,
13823,477,okay,
13824,477,sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax, <laughter> <sniffle> mm i meditate um i do that almost every day um i also walk at the beach i love the ocean and i really like the sounds and just being out there is very peaceful um and i like to read and be alone just with my thoughts
13825,477,mhm, so that's nice
13826,477,that's good,
13827,477,tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently, mm well let me think about that for a minute <sigh> hmm <laughter> i'm having a hard time coming up with anything i mean i i i'm sure there are plenty of things um just nothing comes to mind um <sniffle> <sigh> hmm
13828,477,let's come back to that later, okay i'm sorry <laughter>
13829,477,tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory, hmm well this isn't exactly an event it's it's a dream and it's not a particularly um traumatic dream so as far as dreams go but um i do have it sometimes probably more often than i'd like so i wouldn't be upset if it you know if i didn't have it um and it's just a version of a dream that i think a lot of people probably have but um it's usually me in school somewhere at the end of the semester haven't gone to class taking the exams know i'm going to fail and you know really unhappy about it wishing why didn't i study and attend class the way i should have um which actually wasn't really a problem for me in school but now i have this dream sometimes and it's kinda frustrating and i'm not exactly sure why i mean i know why but i don't know what it applies to because it's not like i am worried consciously at least about failing things so
13830,477,mhm,
13831,477,are they triggered by something, no i don't think so um at least not not that i'm aware of
13832,477,okay,
13833,477,what's something you feel guilty about, <sniffle> i feel guilty um i have a a brother and a sister-in-law and a nephew and they live on the east coast and i love my nephew he's eight he's adorable and um i when i used to live there when he was younger um spent a lot of time with them and since i've been in california and particularly in the last year i've spent a lot less time visiting them so for example i saw them for a week at christmas and then i went back in <i> at the beginning of may so it was you know four months between the last <la> the last time i'd seen them um and that i felt bad about because we really enjoy each other's company and he um you know really likes me to be there but then he gets upset when i leave and he asks when am i coming back so that's um that makes me feel bad sometimes
13834,477,i understand,
13835,477,tell me about your relationship with your family, mm um well i have a brother i'm very close to him he's younger and um he's like four four and a half years younger he's married um i have a nephew um my both of my parents have passed away so it's just the two of us and we have a large extended family but we're not that close with them um with most of them um on my father's side there's one brother um and he's married and has a few kids so i have a few cousins on that side but then on my mother's side there are <sigh> five <fi> four or five other kids um most of them with several children of their own so i have a lot of cousins on that side but they live all over the country and um so we stay in touch a little bit through facebook um and there a couple that i talk to on the phone and visit every now and then but you know we're not that close with our extended family so
13836,477,okay,
13837,477,who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life, um i'd say well um i i mean i have a lot of friends i think that have been positive influences scrubbed_entry when i came out to california um i started working at a nonprofit and it was kind of a strange place it was very different from what i was used to um it was a little bit challenging and she also worked there so um we worked on a program together over the summer and got to know one another and um we just established this really strong friendship and she's kind of i would say my best friend probably here and probably just in general um and now she's moved to vegas um which is a little bit tough for me um but uh we're going to napa this weekend so that should be good um but she's been a very she was a very positive influence because when i came out here and didn't really know anybody um and it you know since i'm an introvert it's not that easy for me to make friends it was really nice because we share a lot of the same values and we have a lot of fun together and you know i think she kinda gets me so it's a lot of fun to hang out with her and and that's been nice
13838,477,that's so good to hear,
13839,477,how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep, i'm a sleeper <laughter> so it's pretty easy um sometimes my you know depending on how long i've been awake <clears throat> i can be wound <wou> a little wound up and so sometimes i have to take a little while to decompress but um i usually meditate right before i go to bed um and that's very helpful um and i can sleep uh you know i i i generally sleep in ninety minute cycles so um you know usually six or seven and a half hours but i can easily sleep nine hours if i have the time and inclination um i usually don't wake up in the middle of the night or at least if i do i don't remember it so
13840,477,uh huh,
13841,477,what are you like when you don't sleep well, um well i don't <do> actually don't sleep very well when i travel <s> one of the things i do for work is i travel uh quite a bit because i work for a company that's back east so i work from home most of the time but then i travel like one week a month and when i travel i'll take the red-eye um and then i'll visit with a lot of friends in the evening so i don't sleep that much it's not that i um sleep poorly or badly it's just that i um don't have that much time to sleep and the first day after not sleeping or not sleeping much is okay but usually the second day is not very good um so i get a lot more tired uh and it's harder to concentrate and um i don't know it just feels like more of a struggle
13842,477,okay,
13843,477,how have you been feeling lately, i would say good um summer is a little <l> is an is a busy time for the organization that i work for so i'm a little um i i don't know <kn> know if stressed is the right word but i'm you know a little anxious about um everything going well this summer but um in general i'm feeling pretty good
13844,477,have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately, not really i can't i can't think of anything um there <th> there is one thing i um i do struggle with exercise like i like to walk a lot um and i hike with friends and um i had been really motivated about it um for a couple of months but then i went away um to the east coast and when i came back i was a lot less motivated um because i didn't really exercise when i was there and i'd gotten out of the habit even though it had only been about ten days and so now i'm struggling to try and get back in the routine and it's not going as well as i would like
13845,477,i'm sorry, it's okay thank you
13846,477,have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d, no
13847,477,have you been diagnosed with depression, no
13848,477,tell me about the last time you felt really happy, hmm well scrubbed_entry he's a lot of fun and um he really likes me and i really like him and we play a lot of games and talk a lot and we're actually doing a book club now so we're gonna skype and um maybe i'll get some more time with him that way but uh just being around him is fun
13849,477,how would your best friend describe you, hmm <sigh> well she'd probably say that i know how to have fun but that i can be serious and um that i you know care about others uh and that i'm loyal and i'm not sure what else um i think those those are probably the main things
13850,477,okay,
13851,477,what are some things you wish you could change about yourself, <sniffle> um i wish i had more self-discipline <laughter> so um i wish that you know i could diet um or eat healthier foods and not have a problem uh with sugar because i love to eat sugar i wish that i would not procrastinate because i've gotten a lot better about that but i still do and that can be challenging um and i wish that i um xxx i don't know uh i think i wish that i was in a relationship so probably those things
13852,477,okay,
13853,477,tell me about a time when someone made you feel really badly about yourself, mm hmm so at the last organization i used to work at i had a boss and she was i don't feel like she was um i don't think we were very compatible um and she uh used to push my buttons or so i thought and so um one day she was really upset about something um because a board member had called her up and asked her a question and she didn't have the answer um and he was upset about something and it was something to do with my department so she called me into her office and let me know how unhappy she was um but it wasn't i i've been a manager for many years um and i have very strong opinions about how you handle challenges with people <peo> with staff members
13854,477,yeah, and the way that she handled the situation with me was really inappropriate i thought um and she clearly was trying to frighten me and make me feel um you know incompetent or at least that's the the way that i felt about it and um i did you know i tried to be very calm and said that i would take care of it and i did take care of it um but uh after that our relationship wasn't really the same and i ended up staying <st> uh leaving there to go back to the old organization that i'd worked for not that long afterwards because i just didn't really have a lot of respect for her after she did that to me or after we had that interaction so
13855,477,yeah,
13856,477,i see,
13857,477,what advice would you give to yourself ten or twenty years ago, <laughter> so i heard this piece of advice the other day and or uh or this thing and that i thought was really profound and i wish that i had read it back then which is um when you think about buying something instead of thinking uh oh here's this beautiful coat it's a hundred dollars i want it i'm gonna buy it it uh don't think of it as costing a hundred dollars think of it as costing ten times that because that's effectively what your money could do if you didn't spend it on that coat but instead invested it you know intelligently um you would have ten times that much money eventually so you should really think about it in those terms and um i think i've been much more a consumer than a saver and so i wish that i had uh been more aware of that ten or twenty years ago
13858,477,hmm,
13859,477,what are you most proud of in your life, <sigh> probably scrubbed_entry um they asked me to be his um godparent and his guardian if anything should happen to them and that meant a lot to me because it it made me feel like they trusted me and thought that i was a good person the kinda person that could take care of their child should something happen to them so
13860,477,okay,
13861,477,tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed, <sigh> let's see well uh in <i> it wasn't really recently but in february i went i like to travel and a friend uh and i went to singapore uh and i got to fly first class um we used miles uh frequent flyer miles to get the um tickets and so uh that was really enjoyable because um the seats pull down you get to sleep the food is delicious you get special attention and um i also hadn't been to singapore before so that was kind of cool too

14056,481,what do you enjoy about traveling, um <sigh> just being somewhere else not having to drive usually most places have better public transportation um just i love <lo> i'm you know i'm a culture junkie i like experiencing different types of cultures so that's
14057,481,i'd love to hear about one of your trips, xxx um well you know i haven't been to that many places i've been to like mexico and italy it it's uh you know i wanna go to more places i wanna go to japan so that'll be that'll be interesting it's usually just with my family um it's my mom sometimes my girlfriend sometimes my brother and we just uh yeah we go to italy we spent two weeks there though that was cool

14061,481,okay,
14062,481,what did you study at school, studied uh film and digital media 'cause uh i make music and i wanted to learn how to make music videos so it's something i'm trying to get into
14063,481,are you still working in that, uh yeah yeah i mean i need to get a camera though that's the thing uh but um i mainly my main focus is music i studied film but my focus is music

14068,481,mhm,
14069,481,do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing, probably outgoing
14070,481,why, um just just feel like it's a way to get the best <be> most out of life uh just talking to people and learning about them and having them learn about you and care about you it's uh kinda just goes with the territory <caritor> territory <laughter>
14071,481,that makes sense,
14072,481,sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax, <laughter> yeah um i uh do meditation and
14073,481,how hard is that, uh it's not really hard 'cause it's fun and it it relaxes me and helps me focus at the same time which uh you know that that was a huge epiphany for me that you can relax and focus at the same time 'cause normally when i'm relaxing i'm i'm tuning out i'm focusing on something else but um to be able to combine those sensations was uh yeah i've been doing that for about uh three months now so
14074,481,that's good, yeah it is
14075,481,how are you at controlling your temper, um almost too good at times <laughter> uh sometimes uh there's things that should be said that i that i don't um just because um you know it's like you're opening up a can of worms maybe one of your friends for example i got a problem with him but they don't have a problem with him necessarily 'cause he didn't do anything to them
14076,481,hmm, and uh i've had to deal with that in the past sort of a awkward social situation but um you know i make do
14077,481,okay,
14078,481,when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about, um <makes sound with mouth> probably argued with uh the guitarist from my band uh we had a falling out we're not gonna be in a band together i mean we're still friends so at least there's that mm but um it was just basically about creative control of the project and how we're gonna prioritize it in in our lives and uh you know we just our priorities weren't the same and i got very upset so that was the end of that
14079,481,how did you feel in that moment, um <sigh> i felt good that it was definitive that it was you know a choice had been made on both parties uh also regretful that you know he didn't feel the way that i wanted him to feel about it which was excited about the project so
14080,481,yeah, the fact that he wasn't really in it kinda pissed me off um but
14081,481,i understand, i got over it um and you know i got some other people that are really really excited to be working with me you know even honored so you know i'm uh i'ma keep going
14082,481,that's great, thank you
14083,481,tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently, um <sigh> hmm i don't know i don't really i don't really have any regrets like that at the moment i can't really think of any um
14084,481,what's something you feel guilty about, <deep breath> um when i was in high school i cheated on my girlfriend i didn't think it would mean anything at the time but i did it i i regret it but um you know xxx you know life happens you make some mistakes
14085,481,yeah,
14086,481,what made you decide to do that, selfishness um being young and thinking it wouldn't matter
14087,481,i see, um you know thinking you know you only live once and you know for eh it was probably for the best ultimately 'cause you know i love my current girlfriend and i would never do that to her so that was <wa> that was years ago but uh she was a nice girl she didn't deserve that so i regret it
14088,481,okay,
14089,481,tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make, <deep breath> um shit geez um i guess uh whether to go to college or not 'cause uh i uh i had some projects going in l_a that i didn't really wanna shut off uh i i had a band going we had a manager um we were playing out a lot and i wasn't sure if i wanted to keep that going or go to school and start over and um i made the decision to go to school in santa cruz and and start a new life there for four years and it it was a difficult decision but i'm glad i did 'cause i met a lot of people a lot of people i'm still close with today that you know we work on stuff together and all that so it's good
14090,481,that's good, i agree it is good <laughter> thank you <laughter>
14091,481,tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory, um maybe i wish i could forget getting spanked in the parking lot when i was four by a danish babysitter uh you know on the abuse scale it's pretty low but it was somewhat humiliating and i i don't forget it so i have a pretty vivid picture of it and i'm i'm i'd be happier if it wasn't there
14092,481,okay,
14093,481,tell me about your relationship with your family, it's positive they're supportive um they give me a hard time sometimes because they don't think that i keep things in perspective in terms of how i'm gonna support myself even though i do it's just um you know i have a a more long range picture than they do and i have faith in myself and the creative projects that i make so
14094,481,mm, yeah there's a bit of tension there just 'cause you know they expect certain things from me and i expect them as well but i just have a different way of going about it than they might prefer
14095,481,yeah, but they're sweet people
14096,481,how do you cope with them, how do i cope with them uh i you know they're lovely people at their core you know um cope with them 'cause i love them i just uh you know at times i'll just uh go off on my own for a while and eh you know take a breather whatever you know xxx everyone makes you mad sometimes so
14097,481,uh huh, <deep breath>
14098,481,yeah,
14099,481,how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep, challenging
14100,481,why, um <sigh> i just i try and it doesn't work um sometimes i have to take medication for it i have to take ambien something like that um yeah it's difficult <di>
14101,481,what are you like when you don't sleep well, i'm someone who sleeps in late so i always get at least six or seven hours if i have to wake up early for something um i get nauseous sometimes i'll throw up in the morning um yeah i've had jobs where i'd wake up and you know vomit while i'm brushing my teeth it's horrible
14102,481,that sucks, it does suck um it's kinda something i'm worried about you know i i kinda need to get some part time work while i'm not you know getting a steady pay flow for my music production so yeah <sigh> it's pretty rough <sigh> got some stuff i need to get over i'm not really sure how
14103,481,like what, just not feeling good getting nervous when you know there's something stressful like a stressful work environment or just something i that doesn't sit well with me like being in a you know a a rushed and you know stressful work environment it just um unless it's about something that i care about you know like music or the arts it's just very hard to to give a shit frankly like and you know i i try to psych myself into giving a shit and it just makes me sick you know maybe i'll have a red bull or something and you know xxx my body doesn't want that in the morning it just i feel like my body rejects things and yeah
14104,481,yeah,
14105,481,how have you been feeling lately, okay i've been feeling okay very uh very reflective very contemplative you know there's gonna be some changes and there's gonna be some new people in my life some new people uh in my band um you know i'm gonna try to push myself but try to stay grounded at the same time 'cause you know i expect more from myself it's just pissing me off when my get my you know i basically feel like i'm shitting all over myself my body's shitting on me anyway just by being so um shitty <laughter> yeah
14106,481,hmm,

14111,481,i understand,
14112,481,what got you to seek help, being forced to it was a private school they thought i was acting up thought i was a uppity kid i think i was just being a kid so

14116,481,(laughter, um well yeah i uh uh i i kinda wanna go back to therapy it might help might help me find some solutions maybe maybe it's not a therapist i need maybe it's a life coach i have no idea but i'll be seeking help soon

14140,482,yeah,
14141,482,what are some things you don't really like about l_a, uh the traffic which is probably <probab> probably most people say um it's expensive to live here those are probably the top two
14142,482,i see what you mean,
14143,482,i'm sure you can tell by my shoes i'm not much of a world explorer do you travel a lot, uh recently i've traveled
14144,482,what do you enjoy about traveling, um well you get to see new places and and new people you get to learn more about other cultures and uh different ways people think
14145,482,i'd love to hear about one of your trips, oh uh at the end of march i went to ecuador for a week
14146,482,nice,
14147,482,what's one of your most memorable experiences, uh um i spent most of most of one day with with an ecuadorian who only speaks spanish and i speak very little spanish so we got um it was it was challenging for me trying to communicate with him i felt like a a little kid
14148,482,yeah, trying to you know say you know what's this what's this uh it was very humbling um you know just just seeing that you know when you don't when you're not able to communicate then that that can be very difficult
14149,482,mhm,
14150,482,do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing, i'm probably more of a shy person
14151,482,why, genetics i don't know why
14152,482,what did you study at school, um i'm an electrician so i studied electrical construction i've also studied uh computer networking
14153,482,cool,
14154,482,how did you decide to do that, um it was i guess just uh kinda circumstances i needed the the the work i was doing wasn't providing for the family and i knew someone who could get me a job doing electrical work and so so i pursued that because of the the financial gain
14155,482,are you happy you did that, mm uh it's given me a lot of opportunity but uh i don't think it's what i what i wanna do for the rest of my life
14156,482,what's your dream job, well i'm actually uh pursuing becoming a missionary uh my wife and i are looking at moving down to ecuador in the fall uh for four years and last year we we trained in north carolina for one year um and that was like theology and bible training
14157,482,what made you decide to do that, um basically god put a um a desire in my heart to get beyond get beyond myself and and do something for other people to to go and and learn about another people their culture and to share the gospel with them
14158,482,that's great,
14159,482,tell me about your relationship with your family, well in my immediate family um i'm i'm married i've been married for ten years this june and we have four daughters and then um but i i have one older brother uh no sisters um so what what do you wanna know about my family
14160,482,how close are you to your family, um i'm really close with my wife and my daughters uh with my brother i'm not not real close partly because he's uh he's mentally handicapped um he has the mental capacity of a seven year old even though he's he's five years older than me so just kinda because of that dynamic it it's hard to have a a close relationship with him but i am pretty close with my parents my brother lives with my parents
14161,482,i see,
14162,482,who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life, um i'd say my my youth pastor in high school he was a real real positive influence in me
14163,482,can you tell me about that, um just he has a he has a drive and a zeal for for pursuing the truth um and just uh studying the bible and and because of his influence that kinda put me on a path to wanting to study the bible
14164,482,okay,
14165,482,how are you at controlling your temper, um i think i've gotten better at it there have been times when you know i'll i'll get angry and uh you know it can just kinda really rule over me just the frustration and i'm the type of person that it takes me um usually it it takes some time for me to get angry and and some time to to calm down again but i've i've learned um over time that really getting angry um and keeping that anger in doesn't it doesn't attack the other person or the thing that i'm angry at it just kinda attacks me and so really it it's not a it's not a good behavior to
14166,482,right, to keep so when <whe> when things anger me i try to uh like talk to the other person say you know this <th> this situation is making me upset i try to kinda talk through it and and resolve it and come to a resolution um even more than just compromising but trying to really resolve the root the problem
14167,482,when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about, um <sigh> well a a couple weeks ago or maybe it was maybe even a month ago um my wife and i were going on a trip with with her parents and her parents had already left um eh we were just driving down to orange country area for this trip and my wife wanted um wanted she had she had expectation of certain things to be done before the trip or certain things be packed and but hadn't really in <i> in my eyes hadn't expressed that clearly but in her eyes she had and so when i was trying to meet those expectations she um you know i i didn't meet 'em according to to what she wanted and and and she became angry and so from my perspective i was doing what she wanted um and kinda getting attacked for it so so then i i i started yelling at her and
14168,482,yeah, and we you know we had that conflict but then you know with <wi> within an hour or so we had kinda talked through and we we had figured out what the the cause of that conflict was
14169,482,how did you feel in that moment, um are you asking the moment of during the conflict
14170,482,yeah, uh very you know just mm very angry you know you can feel it in your body um part partly i the i guess the anger was probably the secondary response but my initial response was that um i felt <f> was feeling attacked and that came out as anger
14171,482,mm, so i would think um yeah so initially i felt attacked and then that resulted in the anger
14172,482,okay,
14173,482,tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make, mm hmm hmm hmm i guess it was um deciding to go um to go to our training last year um i i felt that god had put on my heart that that this was something i was supposed to pursue um my wife didn't feel that way and i i i just felt very strongly that that was something that we should pursue and but at the same time i knew that if if my wife wasn't supportive of it that it it would it would kinda fall apart so i kinda relinquished <r> relinquished it um and i and i said to her you know i'm not gonna make you go um you know if if you wanna go then <th> then we'll go but if not then we'll we'll do something else we'll we'll look at at doing something else and not going uh and so that that was difficult for me 'cause uh you know again that that that kinda felt like a loss 'cause i felt deeply that that's what i was supposed to do um but then after i kinda gave that up then um then she came to a point where she said no i have a peace about about doing this and then we went ahead and pursued it so um so just kinda giving it up was <wa> was <wa> was difficult for me
14174,482,yeah,
14175,482,tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory, tell you about something bad or something that i can erase from my memory
14176,482,mhm, um oh let me see i'm not sure um i don't know i i can't really think of anything very traumatic um that i would wanna erase but i i think you know good things and positive <posi> eh good things and bad things they all kinda shape who we are and so i i i can't think of anything that i would want to erase
14177,482,okay,

14193,482,what are some things you wish you could change about yourself, um i guess i would um i guess i would like to be able to um start conversations with people easier uh sometimes i have i have trouble just talking to people especially if they're in a group if <i> if people are one on one then it's it's usually easier for me to talk to them but kinda talking to people in a group uh i wish i was a little better at that
14194,482,uh huh, now if it's
14195,482,what advice would you give to yourself ten or twenty years ago, okay what what i was gonna say right before that was that um uh if if i'm giving a speech or something to a large group i don't really have a problem with that but if it's more interaction type thing then that's kinda difficult uh advice i would've given to myself ten or twenty years ago um probably would've been to to go to college right away instead of going to school later in life um that's about it

14216,483,what are some things you don't really like about l_a, <sigh> the drivers they're crazy
14217,483,(laughter,
14218,483,i see what you mean,
14219,483,i'm sure you can tell by my shoes i'm not much of a world explorer do you travel a lot, mm not really kind of but not much anymore
14220,483,why, don't have the money kinda broke <laughter>
14221,483,i understand,
14222,483,what do you enjoy about traveling, just being able to go on an adventure
14223,483,i'd love to hear about one of your trips, um let's see i once went to comic con on a on a bicycle like on a a three wheel bike um and that that was pretty fun kinda scary and dangerous nearly got killed <laughter> it was scary <laughter>
14224,483,what's one of your most memorable experiences, traveling or just in general
14225,483,whatever comes to your mind, hmm um i gotta say i gotta say we were we were heading out of um we were heading off the p_c_h and going into um laguna and laguna has this really steep hill and on sundays it's full of traffic and i i remember going down the the hill and my brakes weren't working and i was trying to hit my brakes and trying to hit my brakes and they just they wouldn't click and i was like oh god and i'm i'm on a three wheel bike so i'm larger than most bikes and i'm like zipping in between like gridlock traffic going down a hill unable to brake and i'm going down and suddenly there's this car that veers right into mm essentially where i'm trying to go so i turn sharply in front of between this bus and this truck and literally end up going sideways through traffic through oncoming traffic and then <laughter> looping back through oncoming traffic back into the right traffic still without any brakes and like not managing to keep my bike from
14226,483,(laughter, rolling which is painful when your bike roles kinda hurts a lot
14227,483,oh my gosh, so yeah yeah that's it
14228,483,okay, <laughter>
14229,483,what did you study at school, um various different things uh anthropology visual effects kinda weird but yeah
14230,483,that sounds interesting,
14231,483,how did you decide to do that, um i just i've always had a fascination with film and i i think the way people do things and go about things is fascinating just as like the the mob mentality of people
14232,483,yeah, especially
14233,483,what's your dream job, ooh dream job um huh i have no idea just a job i guess
14234,483,okay,
14235,483,do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing, i consider myself more outgoing
14236,483,why, um you know i i've never been afraid of what people think of me like people xxx i i i like people i don't know
14237,483,mhm, i'm not i'm not afraid of what they think eh i'm more concerned with like the people i know and what they think of me i guess so being outgoing just doesn't really affect me
14238,483,i see what you mean, eh
14239,483,sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax, um <deep breath> <mumbling> <sigh> uh i play video games listen to music um yeah read books i like reading books and drawing reading books drawing playing video games did i think of anything did i forget anything sleeping
14240,483,uh huh, i like sleeping it's fun
14241,483,how are you at controlling your temper, uh <mumbling> not good
14242,483,has that gotten you in trouble, <laughter> frequently <laughter>
14243,483,can you tell me about that, um <sigh> uh in high school i i shoved somebody's head through a locker um yeah yeah that that's not good don't ever shove someone's head into a locker that's a great way to get suspended um i don't know yeah things like that just getting into fights
14244,483,when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about, <sigh> um like a serious argument
14245,483,whatever comes to your mind, um <sigh> uh i guess like xxx argument over over um uh i guess over like uh like viewpoints on like gun control and gun control laws i mean
14246,483,uh huh, it was like yesterday evening
14247,483,how did you feel in that moment, eh it was it it was an argument about you know gun control regulation i mean it doesn't really affect me personally but that was like the last argument i got into that that's kinda what you specified i think
14248,483,okay,
14249,483,tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently, ooh um uh my entire life um <laughter> uh <mumbling> <sigh> i have um about two years ago i broke up with like as everyone calls her my evil ex and um yeah it was just it was bad the whole the whole thing went down bad i mean uh eh <sigh> uh i think i've calmed down a lot since then like just as a person as a whole but i mean i was angry and stuff i think i like went riding my bike for like a hundreds plus miles in a singular day
14250,483,hmm, and i was in a ton of pain like later in the evening i got home i was like oh god like i could barely walk um and yeah i i think running off and like going on a like extreme cycling spree was not good but it was better than like eating too much and like just overeating 'cause i was depressed but yeah like we we fought and screamed and it was it was not good like i we didn't physically fight it was more like a screaming match of death
14251,483,yeah,
14252,483,tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make, <deep breath> <sigh> hmm um i don't think i've had a singular hard decision i've had ever had to make because my my biggest thing in life is don't you know don't regret don't regret the the the things you do just regret the opportunites you've missed and that's like had to come with me that's like had to i've had to like learn that in the past like two years like two years ago i totally just could not grasp that concept
14253,483,mm, and to answer your question i think thinking about it the hardest decision i've had to make is i'd say probably probably to break up with my ex probably
14254,483,what made you decide to do that, um xxx <sigh> ooh um <sigh> where do i begin <sigh> um my ex was not a good person just in any way shape or form of the word um she did some things that i wasn't entirely comfortable with um just to the the people around her and to me and i <deep breath> <laughter> you know they say you're supposed to give forgive people for making mistakes or doing things and i just i think there are some things you can't forgive people for no matter how hard you try and i think there are some things that once done that that can't be undone they just they're they're the way that they are and i think i think after what she did i i like i just xxx eh things just fell apart after that it just it it we mm despite us trying it just it didn't work out i mean i i i don't know i don't really wanna talk about exactly what happened
14255,483,okay,
14256,483,tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory, oh geez oh man erase from my memory or just erase from ever happening um huh i don't <sigh> you know that's hard um katrina just the experience of katrina for starters um <laughter> my <m> my ex i i guess between those two it's it's kinda hard i'd i'd actually rather lean towards uh katrina 'cause that was just that that was not i mean i i guess you don't exactly know about it but um in two thousand five um uh this giant storm hit uh new orleans louisiana um killed a whole bunch of people leveled the town um and um i i lost a lot of friends during the storm um i mean i'm kind of i'm getting over it but it's still it's it's still there and i think uh i i don't know i mean you can try and look at you can try your best to try and find something positive in that but there's just there's nothing the only thing you can do is <i> is just think that that was like a freak accident and it'll never happen again though <laughter> i live in l_a and you know <laughter> earthquakes <laughter> they could happen <laughter> and i just think oh i'd rather rather know that it's coming than not know it's coming
14257,483,yeah,
14258,483,have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d, yes
14259,483,have you been diagnosed with depression, <laughter> yeah
14260,483,how long ago were you diagnosed, <sigh> um mm depression it's reoccurred multiple times that's no surprise um first time i was diagnosed was in middle school um which would've been <sigh> ten well twelve <twel> ten between ten twelve years ago i don't know xxx i don't know whenever i was in the sixth grade that's it's when i first was told that i was depressed
14261,483,mhm, um as far as p_t_s_d goes um post katrina um and then you know uh just post katrina mostly <laughter> that was the big thing
14262,483,what got you to seek help, um i guess having been diagnosed previously as being depressed and still being in high school it kinda wasn't i wasn't really seeking help it's kind of i got i kinda got into my high school and they were like here's help 'cause we know you're gonna need it um and i was like oh well thanks i didn't really ask for it but okay i'll take it um you know just kinda happened
14263,483,do you still go to therapy now, no not not anymore
14264,483,why did you stop, um eh <sigh> <laughter> that's a good question um <laughter> uh geez uh you know i really don't know i guess it just kinda stopped just kinda was like well i'm not gonna do this anymore
14265,483,do you feel like therapy is useful, uh sometimes sometimes it's a lot of like how are you feeling today and stuff and you know it's kind of well i'm feeling fine right now but ask me in two hours and who knows you know
14266,483,right,
14267,483,how has seeing a therapist affected you, um <sigh> i guess it it's helped me understand that some of the things that just happen just happen and to just get on and move along with your life um mm essentially just mm like carry on you know things will happen carry on
14268,483,yeah,
14269,483,tell me about the last time you felt really happy, <sigh> um wow <laughter> um uh i was um i was hanging out with my girlfriend just hanging out
14270,483,that's so good to hear,
14271,483,what are some things you wish you could change about yourself, um well for starters i mean you <y> you can't see when i walked in but i'm walking with a cane right now 'cause i i got hit by a car recently and uh i'd i'd make my leg better um let's see cane's over there that way but anyway um <sigh> i don't know uh make myself less fat <laughter> um i'd make it so i don't feel the incessant need to sleep fourteen hours a day um 'cause when you sleep like more than ten hours a day it's just it's unproductive you waste too much time like i have friends who are like oh you know i feel rejuvenated after six hours and i'm like how do you do that i have to sleep like twelve hours to feel good like you can sleep six you know like in in in crunch time you know you can get away with four i have to get away with seven or eight you know
14272,483,yeah, like that that's my crunch time sleep schedule eight hours it's just i don't know i oversleep but i like sleeping too
14273,483,i see what you mean, i mean yeah it's just the oversleeping part i don't like so much
14274,483,okay,
14275,483,how would your best friend describe you, um <sigh> um utterly insane in a good way utterly insane in a good way
14276,483,(laughter, um uh i guess like they they would also say like you know there <the> there are times where i might seem like an asshole and i'm i'm not really an asshole i just you know i i just have issues like everybody else um specifically i have uh asperger's so that's a form of autism um that just kinda makes life awesome they'd also say i'm flamboyant and eccentric 'cause i totally am i just i i don't know i figure i'm still alive so i should live because i'm still alive and you know who knows how long i'm gonna be alive for so i should you know live while i'm alive and just go out and do stuff and not not sit and be calm
14277,483,yeah, except when i'm reading and i like reading
14278,483,okay,
14279,483,what advice would you give to yourself ten or twenty years ago, <sigh> um uh stop fucking up um no uh that's kinda messed up um i think i would've told myself at the time um 'cause <ca> 'cause i i i've known my my evil ex um i've known her since like i was like six and she was five i think ten years ago i would've grabbed myself by the shoulders and say you see that girl whatever you do do not date that girl don't trust her she can't be trusted um and more importantly don't <deep breath> don't let your guard down around her 'cause she'll she'll exploit that
14280,483,mm, and i mean like physically let your guard down not mentally um yeah don't don't date her just don't do it it's not worth it <laughter> it's not worth the trouble it's not worth the pain it's not worth it
14281,483,okay,
14282,483,what are you most proud of in your life, <sigh> um the fact that i'm still alive maybe yeah uh i don't know cycling to comic con i was pretty proud of that pretty proud that i managed to do it um just i don't you know i don't really know i don't really use the term pride i don't really feel pride i'm just it's it's more of like the fact that i'm still alive i'm proud to be alive <laughter>
14283,483,yeah, i don't know if that makes me humble or just insane who knows
14284,483,okay i think i have asked everything i need to,
14285,483,thanks for sharing your thoughts with me,
14286,483,goodbye, do i press the button now oh bye
14287,483,yeah,
14288,484,hi i'm ellie thanks for coming in today i was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment i'm not a therapist but i'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you i'll ask a few questions to get us started and please feel free to tell me anything your answers are totally confidential are you ok with this, yes
14289,484,okay,
14290,484,so how are you doing today, i'm doing well
14291,484,that's good,
14292,484,where are you from originally, i was born in oakland
14293,484,really,
14294,484,what are some things you really like about l_a, um <sigh> all the different areas of the city uh the different cultures that are here
14295,484,mhm,
14296,484,what are some things you don't really like about l_a, the traffic the um lack of public transportation and the superficiality
14297,484,i see what you mean,
14298,484,i'm sure you can tell by my shoes i'm not much of a world explorer do you travel a lot, <laughter> i i don't i would love to travel more
14299,484,what do you enjoy about traveling, um <sigh> being able to experience a different way of living um getting outside the bubble that you normally live in and getting a different perspective
14300,484,uh huh,
14301,484,i'd love to hear about one of your trips, um in two thousand eight i studied abroad in brazil and that was about four months and i was in bahia which is in the north and um let's see the program consisted of learning the history learning the language and staying with a homestay family
14302,484,nice,
14303,484,what made you decide to do that, um i've always wanted to travel and i chose brazil because um they have an afro-brazilian population or a large afro-brazilian population which i really wanted to learn more about and i think the history and the cullture is really interesting
14304,484,mhm,
14305,484,what's one of your most memorable experiences, um i think taking a bus by myself to a remote beach and just navigating on my own and um figuring out where to go yeah
14306,484,that's great,
14307,484,what did you study at school, right now i'm getting my master's in social work
14308,484,what's your dream job, <laughter> dream job <sigh> i think to um consult about um mental health and how to um how to intervene effectively with different cultures and doing research and consulting work and getting to travel um basically that those would be the main characteristics
14309,484,okay,
14310,484,do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing, i think that's a false dichotomy but i do consider myself shy but at the same time outgoing in the sense that i push myself to do things outside of my comfort zone and i'm determined to do what it takes to become successful
14311,484,that makes sense,
14312,484,sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax, <laughter> um i listen to music and just lay on my bed and um i guess you could say do mindfulness and really just take my mind off of things
14313,484,mhm, also breathing exercises which i'm learning more about um as well as exercise
14314,484,cool,
14315,484,how are you at controlling your temper, pretty good i don't get angry a lot um so as far as angry temperament i'm pretty good at that
14316,484,that's good,
14317,484,when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about, hmm um mm what month is this may probably two months ago and i argued via text message <laughter> so it's not really intense arguing but i guess you could call it arguing in a sense over whether or not i should be forgiven for something that i thought was minor um with a friend i've had for a few years
14318,484,hmm,
14319,484,how did you feel in that moment, i felt anxious um sad and angry um yeah those are the main emotions
14320,484,okay,
14321,484,how do you know them, i know them because i think i'm pretty in touch with my emotions and being able to identify them and then i'll notice the physical uh manifestations of emotions like if i if my heart's racing or if i'm getting sweaty if i'm <sigh> if my breathing is more shallow i'll know i'm anxious i'll know something's bothering me
14322,484,mhm,
14323,484,tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently, hmm <laughter> that i wish i had handled differently i guess related to this argument um i went out one night and got a little too intoxicated and <clears throat> ended up calling a person for a ride home but that really upset that person and i know that it wasn't such a big deal but i wish i hadn't have let myself get to that point um it it impacted a relationship and i also felt really bad about what i did
14324,484,okay,
14325,484,tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make, mm <clears throat> hardest decision <sigh> wow um probably deciding what type of graduate program to go into i briefly went to law school and decided not to do that so afterwards well after dropping out i had to really rethink what it is that i wanted to do and what i wanted to dedicate my life to go into debt for spend a lot of energy on
14326,484,yeah,
14327,484,how did you decide to do that, um <sigh> i think by recognizing what i don't want to do and doing a lot of research on program requirements and the jobs that you can get after completing a program
14328,484,that makes sense,
14329,484,tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory, <sigh> mm <sigh> i have to think <sigh> oh <laughter> um revolving around the same person i spoke of earlier it was a dating relationship and a few years ago we had a falling out over his treatment of me and it involved another person and i wish i could get that out of my mind
14330,484,i'm sorry to hear that,
14331,484,tell me about your relationship with your family, um <laughter> <laughter> i have a pretty good relationship with my mom she lives in the bay area i didn't grow up with her but i've gotten um closer to her as an adult uh we talk pretty regularly with my dad i grew up with him mostly he lives in atlanta and um we don't talk as much but we are we have a pretty decent relationship it's not really that contentious or anything and i'm an only child so i don't have siblings i don't have a large family
14332,484,uh huh, um so in general i'm not really that close to family
14333,484,who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life, um one person is my mentor who i met in two thousand five and she's a judge and i met her when i was in community college and she really opened my eyes to possibilities and made me feel that i would be able to achieve certain things
14334,484,that's great,
14335,484,how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep, <sigh> pretty easy well it's easy for me to sleep what's not easy is getting up
14336,484,why, because usually i do not forward <f> look forward to what i have to do that day and the thought of it is you know just makes me wanna stay in bed also i wake up pretty tired not really feeling refreshed
14337,484,i understand, <clears throat>
14338,484,how do you cope with them, i think just <sigh> self-talk about how what i have to do isn't that bad or that the things that i'm doing now are gonna end pretty soon with the end of the school year um trying to think of things that i can look forward to in the week um also listening to music and browsing the internet kinda gets my mind going
14339,484,mhm,
14340,484,how have you been feeling lately, <sigh> feeling <sigh> uh wow um feeling emotionally drained on some ways and at the same time feeling like i've accomplished a lot and that i've grown so a mix of ambivalence and feeling drained and a mixture of feeling accomplished and proud at the same time

14344,484,how long ago were you diagnosed, in two thousand six
14345,484,what got you to seek help, the convergence of a lot of stressful factors um i was out of touch with my mom i started um well i had transferred to a university that was pretty rigorous and just all those changes going on really um exacerbated  things that were already there depressive tendencies that were already there and it got to a point where i just felt really overwhelmed

14514,486,goodbye,
14515,487,hi i'm ellie thanks for coming in today i was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment i'm not a therapist but i'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you i'll ask a few questions to get us started and please feel free to tell me anything your answers are totally confidential are you ok with this, yes
14516,487,okay,
14517,487,so how are you doing today, i'm fine thank you
14518,487,that's good,
14519,487,where are you from originally, detroit michigan
14520,487,really, yes
14521,487,when did you move to l_a, i moved to l_a myself in two thousand and seven but my family came here many more years ago more like forty years ago
14522,487,mm,
14523,487,how often do you go back to your hometown, uh i don't go back to detroit anymore
14524,487,why, i really don't like the weather and i really don't have any reason to most of my immediate family is out here in california and
14525,487,that makes sense,
14526,487,how does it compare to l_a, uh completely different um for me detroit was just very cold it it wasn't the best for my personality i prefer l_a more open space a warmer climate warmer people just a different different uh vibe
14527,487,mhm, that i that i like better
14528,487,why did you move to l_a, after my husband and i relationship ended i had family out here so i thought it would be easier to start over here than some of the other places i had lived or to stay where we were at
14529,487,how easy was it for you to get used to living in l_a, extremely easy i came out here every year to visit while i was in college so i was extremely used to it plus i had also taken um six months out of off of school and lived out here and went to school out here so i was completely used to it
14530,487,that's good,
14531,487,yeah,
14532,487,what are some things you really like about l_a, well like i said the weather is number one it's just uh less crowded it's more open space it's a a calmer friendlier vibe less rushed the smog would be one and when i drive the traffic in certain areas it can be but um in general there's not a lot that i don't like <l> it's like i guess the overall threat of earthquake but that's isn't really that much of a factor 'cause it rarely happens
14533,487,i see what you mean, the price of real estate <laughter> that's another one that i don't necessarily like
14534,487,yeah,
14535,487,i'm sure you can tell by my shoes i'm not much of a world explorer do you travel a lot, i can't see your shoes i can't see your shoes at all so i don't travel as much as i used to but i have traveled worldwide
14536,487,what do you enjoy about traveling, new experiences
14537,487,i'd love to hear about one of your trips, well i used to be an international flight attendant and then later i traveled through my work as a cruise line and as an international sales account executive so i've traveled a lot of different places and um i'll have to say they were all pretty much enjoyable 'cause you know there's different cultures different things to see do learn enjoy experience
14538,487,uh huh,
14539,487,what's one of your most memorable experiences, uh my experiences i would say in um europe visiting moreso i've also visited uh in south south america i guess 'cause the cultures are so very different
14540,487,yeah,
14541,487,do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing, i would probably say more shy um in general um compared to people who i know are really really outgoing although i've had them describe me as outgoing
14542,487,okay,
14543,487,sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax, i like to read i like to walk or power walk or hike
14544,487,mhm, listen to music you know
14545,487,how are you at controlling your temper, i'm very good at controlling my temper
14546,487,when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about, oh probably when i was married with my husband many years ago it it could be many things i don't even know in specific but just anything in general pretty much could turn into a debate slash argument with him
14547,487,okay, it could be it could be a choice of
14548,487,tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently, uh some of the instances when i might've been with him and i you know got emotional or let it bother me that he made such a big deal of something rather than um just you know seen it as not something to respond to perhaps but it would always be we're we were also pushed to answer so you know you can't always just say ignore a person there 'cause many times it's just a matter of ignoring situation and it doesn't escalate but some people you know don't respond to the so-called norm if you ignore it mm uh they'll just you know de-escalate but that's not always the case i taught middle school kids and you can try calm
14549,487,yeah, um methods with them but that doesn't always work but you always have to as the teacher maintain you know your professional demeanor so you can't really um even when they you know the kids do something outrageous or possibly dangerous to themselves or other kids so
14550,487,i see what you mean,
14551,487,tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make, well that could be several mm um i guess a decision in um along with my mom deciding to let a relative have surgery uh that you know the outcome was uncertain it could go either way and in that case she died so you know uh it's a pretty hard decision 'cause you don't know but you also know if you don't that it could be very serious outcome for them as well
14552,487,yeah,
14553,487,i'm sorry to hear that, mhm
14554,487,tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory, <sigh> oh many different things that could occur you know in life you always are second guessing things that you might could do but they also can be learning experiences so is it necessarily a good thing to erase them you know if you can look at it as positive sometimes people can have a strong reaction and they don't really look past the uh impact of the event 'cause there might be something that
14555,487,mm, you can gain from that
14556,487,yeah, but there are i i grew up in a home of dysfunction so there was just domestic abuse you know and um there were many incidences so you can't just say only one 'cause there is lots of traumatic things but it also would've been a different outcome in say learning to deal with some of the things that occur in life as an adult that sometimes i see among acquaintances or friends that have not had really strong experiences fall apart or just have very very difficult times dealing with so
14557,487,right,
14558,487,how do you cope with them, um you can listen you know you and i and i 'cause i understand that not everybody's had the same experience you know you can walk them through levels of understanding and you know as you know someone you have a balance of background information on which to help them pull from and to see that you know things will progress in a better way knowing that this isn't like the end of the world or as terrible as it seems that it could be and you can also relate other experiences to them of things that were worse or you know seem to be and of course there's always in general i mean when you look at all the calamities in the world you know most of those things aren't affecting us or the people that we know here
14559,487,mhm, so that provides us perspective that you know can pull someone out of their i won't necessarily say self-absorption but the seemingly intensity of their experience right at the moment
14560,487,yeah,
14561,487,tell me about your relationship with your family, well we have a a good relationship they eh for the most part there are different levels of um stress and trauma that some of my siblings have experienced so it has made them interact with life and people you know more intensely than others some have not had um as much experience in life that will help them deal with things you know in a different way so it's always evolving and i walk in positivity as a a lead of you know uh the way i respond to uh try and engender a more positive response from them rather than feed sometimes the um very strong reactions or responses or interactions that they may have
14562,487,mm,
14563,487,who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life, pardon i didn't <di> i didn't hear you could you repeat
14564,487,who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life, hmm hmm my mother different teachers friends
14565,487,can you tell me about that, well my mother has always been a very calm um person for the most part easygoing even though she's experienced a lot of negativity i've had teachers that have um been very um positive <po> positive and proactive and have you know taught independent thinking and techniques to rise above some of the things that were occurring and just various friends that you know i would see handling situations sometimes more much more more difficult you know dealing with things so
14566,487,okay,
14567,487,how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep, it depends for the most part it's you know pretty good um it depends if i'm dealing with a lot of things or studying or you know um trying to get more hours in the day 'cause i need to get things done then you know it's less but um in general i don't have a problem sleeping it's just if i make myself stay awake <aw> stay up because there's more stuff that i wanna get done
14568,487,i see what you mean,
14569,487,how have you been feeling lately, i've been feeling okay uh less you know stressful in xxx it it goes in general 'cause i'm got several projects that i'm working on so um but in general good
14570,487,have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately, like i mean not in particular i mean i just seems um less stressful as i get more stuff done i just and the stress comes from sometimes there being a lot more things to do in a shorter period of time but you know reorganizing some of the things that need to be done you know can smoothe that out
14571,487,okay,
14572,487,have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d, no i haven't but i know it's something that a lot of uh say veterans in particular have people have
14573,487,right,
14574,487,have you been diagnosed with depression, i have not no
14575,487,tell me about the last time you felt really happy, well there's several i guess um and happiness comes in small or large things but in general every day <d> every day every every moment to me is i mean <mea> i mean every day every morning is great wonderful you know day of happiness um as far as big celebratory kinds of things i don't have big highs and lows like that i think it's something that should be on your continuum you know in every day it can be a really great meal it could be a great view it could be
14576,487,yeah, you know a moment shared with someone you know so it should be an even on an even keel
14577,487,i understand,
14578,487,mhm,
14579,487,how would your best friend describe you, um as uh uh perseverant um you know i will continue forth and and um positive upbeat
14580,487,is there anything you regret, um maybe not doing things differently when i were younger like spending my money differently or or spending my time you know a little more differently but that's hard to say it's like okay as your get older you can see you know you could've done some things differently instead of buying the house that i did i would've you know waited and bought another one i mean things like that
14581,487,what advice would you give to yourself ten or twenty years ago, i would have um made myself move to california sooner and i'm i would have um instead of buying the house that i bought then if i'd know i would <ss> would have you know the situation i have now waited to get something different but you know how can you you know have that hindsight you make the best decision that you can at the time with the best information <in> information available
14582,487,yeah, you know after you have looked at several options
14583,487,mhm,
14584,487,what are you most proud of in your life, of um being independent and educated able to uh take care of myself
14585,487,that's great,

14588,487,goodbye,
14589,488,hi i'm ellie thanks for coming in today i was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment i'm not a therapist but i'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you i'll ask a few questions to get us started and please feel free to tell me anything your answers are totally confidential are you ok with this, yes
14590,488,okay,
14591,488,so how are you doing today, fine
14592,488,that's good,
14593,488,where are you from originally, oh san fernando valley
14594,488,really,
14595,488,what are some things you really like about l_a, uh well i really like the culture i love going to museums and being able to go at night and having lots of people around
14596,488,mhm,
14597,488,what are some things you don't really like about l_a, it's spread out a lot and it's a pain in the ass to have to drive everywhere and not have a good public transportation system
14598,488,i see what you mean,
14599,488,i'm sure you can tell by my shoes i'm not much of a world explorer do you travel a lot, uh not really i like to go camping but i don't really travel
14600,488,when was the last time that happened, um i think <sigh> it might've been around six months ago i went on a trip with a geology class
14601,488,nice, yeah it was fun
14602,488,what's one of your most memorable experiences, hmm <sigh> i think it's tough to say
14603,488,whatever comes to your mind, um well i think the first time i went camping was probably really memorable i went to death valley and i got to see a lot of really cool things and hang out with my friends at night
14604,488,awesome,
14605,488,what did you study at school, philosophy
14606,488,are you still working in that, yes
14607,488,how did you decide to do that, um hmm i don't know i think it just sort of happened i wanted to be a journalist for a really long time and then i kind of grew disillusioned with that and i liked all the different ways or all the different things i could do with philosophy
14608,488,that makes sense,
14609,488,what's your dream job, huh i don't know but i really like children and i really like studying their behavior so i think something along those lines might be it
14610,488,okay,
14611,488,do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing, i think i'm generally pretty outgoing i tend to be shy around my family but when i'm around friends and stuff i i think i'm pretty friendly
14612,488,uh huh,
14613,488,sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax, um a lot of times i'll watch t_v or read um yeah
14614,488,how are you at controlling your temper, i think i'm pretty good i don't really get mad i try to think about other things if i start getting mad or um i just start trying to focus on my breathing
14615,488,when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about, i think the last time i argued with someone it was probably with my boyfriend um but i'm having trouble remembering what the last thing we argued about was um i think it was <wa> i wasn't feeling very well and i was having trouble deciding whether i wanted to go to his department's end of year party and he was getting frustrated which i thought was very inconsiderate 'cause i wasn't feeling well to begin with
14616,488,yeah,
14617,488,how did you feel in that moment, well i felt like he wasn't really taking my feelings into consideration and i really hate when he gets stressed out or gets angry easily because i just see that as unnecessary and it stresses me out
14618,488,i see,
14619,488,tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently, hmm i think a lot of times when my oldest youngest brother or my oldest little brother uh does something wrong i tend to be harsh with him um we're not as close as my sister and i or my youngest brother and i and so he tends to be hostile back and i think that if i were a little bit more gentle it might be easier to communicate with him
14620,488,okay,
14621,488,tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory, hmm um when i was nineteen i came home from a party i think around four a_m on a sunday morning and my dad got really mad at me and yelled at me said a lot of not very nice things and then he didn't speak to me for about a year
14622,488,i'm sorry,
14623,488,tell me about your relationship with your family, uh well my relationship with my mom is a lot better now that i don't live at home um i used to be really frustrated with her all the time 'cause she has a really quick temper but i think now that i've got a little bit more distance i can see that she did the best that she could um <sigh> and i love my siblings i again my little sister and i get along really well she's four years younger than me and when when she was around twelve and i was around sixteen it was really difficult 'cause she had a really harsh temper and she was always moody and i wasn't in a place to be patient with that sort of stuff so we fought all the time but we don't anymore and that's really great and we get along okay with my uh my older little brother who's fifteen and i think i get along pretty well with my youngest brother who's twelve
14624,488,that's good,
14625,488,who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life, scrubbed_entry one of the first not the first but one of my first philosophy professors and i really loved her classes and it was really good uh being in a class with a professor who really cared and who really engaged people that was really motivating since not all my classes were like that
14626,488,that's great,
14627,488,how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep, i think it's pretty easy i mean sometimes i'll have trouble going to sleep but generally it's not that bad it's i think it's usually harder for me to wake up in the morning
14628,488,what are you like when you don't sleep well, um well i'm really tired i can get grumpy but i think usually i'm just groggy
14629,488,okay,
14630,488,how have you been feeling lately, pretty good i'm a little anxious about um about getting a job and i'm gonna be taking summer school about it's only one class so i'll have a lot of free time um yeah
14631,488,how do you cope with them, <sigh> well i mean it's not the end of the world if i don't get a job but i know that i will eventually so mostly i think i just try not to think about it too much and i try not to be pessimistic
14632,488,okay,
14633,488,have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d, no
14634,488,have you been diagnosed with depression, no
14635,488,tell me about the last time you felt really happy, hmm well i think the last time i felt really happy i went to a party with my boyfriend the end of department party and um i was the you know i knew a couple people there so i felt comfortable but i was also able to meet new people and there were a couple kids there splashing around in the pool and i had a couple drinks and ate some food and it was fun
14636,488,that's great,
14637,488,how would your best friend describe you, um she would probably say that i'm smart and uh pretty intellectual i love to read and to watch really like serious films and t_v um and she would probably also say that i'm fun 'cause we like to go out and have fun a lot
14638,488,what are some things you wish you could change about yourself, well i'm kinda <ki> i can be really disorganized and that gets me in trouble sometimes so um so that's a major one that and procrastinating
14639,488,tell me about a time when someone made you feel really badly about yourself, hmm um i got into a little bit of trouble a few months back and had to go to court and was uh uh given eh sixty some hours of community service and of course i procrastinated on doing that so i had to show up to court again to get an extension and the judge was very mean and he didn't seem i mean he yelled at me but it didn't seem like he gave it much thought it seemed like it was just sort of a stock speech he gave everyone that he thought needed some yelling at so i understand 'cause that's his job but it was was not great for me 'cause i wasn't i i was really anxious in that situation
14640,488,that sucks,
14641,488,what advice would you give to yourself ten or twenty years ago, well i would've been twelve and two um but i think i think i would've told myself at twelve not to be so hard on myself and not to be so hard on my parents 'cause i think i was a little selfish and self-involved back then
14642,488,is there anything you regret, i can't really think of anything i mean i regret how i treated my mother when i was a kid but everyone does that and um i do regret a couple of semesters ago i didn't do so well in school and i got a a few ws which i now have to work to get off on my transcript
14643,488,could you have done anything to avoid it, i think so i'm i think i i wasn't focusing in school at that time and i didn't see any counselors at school or anything so i definitely could've done that
14644,488,okay,
14645,488,tell me how you spend your ideal weekend, hmm i think i'd probably spend my ideal weekend sleeping in saturday and then going hiking or maybe just going to the duck pond by my house and feeding ducks and picking some oranges and then maybe going out to breakfast sunday and just like window shopping
14646,488,mhm, and maybe watching a little bit of t_v
14647,488,what are you most proud of in your life, huh well my youngest brother is autistic and my mom and dad were always working when he was growing up i'm ten years older than him so and being the oldest i always i always took care of him which made me really really patient because he was a handful but i'm really proud of how he turned out and um and how close we are
14648,488,aw,
